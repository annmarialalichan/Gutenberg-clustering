KINGSTON BROOKS, POLITICAL AGENT\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready the sweepers were busy in the deserted hall, and the lights\\r\\nburned low. Of the great audience who had filled the place only\\r\\nhalf-an-hour ago not one remained. The echoes of their tumultuous\\r\\ncheering seemed still to linger amongst the rafters, the dust which\\r\\ntheir feet had raised hung about in a little cloud. But the long rows\\r\\nof benches were empty, the sweepers moved ghostlike amongst the shadows,\\r\\nand an old woman was throwing tealeaves here and there about the\\r\\nplatform. In the committee-room behind a little group of men were busy\\r\\nwith their leave-takings. The candidate, a tall, somewhat burly man,\\r\\nwith hard, shrewd face and loosely knit figure, was shaking hands with\\r\\nevery one. His tone and manner savoured still of the rostrum.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-night, sir! Good-night, Mr. Bullsom! A most excellent\\r\\nintroduction, yours, sir! You made my task positively easy.\\r\\nGood-night, Mr. Brooks. A capital meeting, and everything very well\\r\\narranged. Personally I feel very much obliged to you, sir. If you\\r\\ncarry everything through as smoothly as this affair to-night, I can see\\r\\nthat we shall lose nothing by poor Morrison\\'s breakdown. Good-night,\\r\\ngentlemen, to all of you. We will meet at the club at eleven o\\'clock\\r\\nto-morrow morning. Eleven o\\'clock precisely, if you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe candidate went out to his carriage, and the others followed in twos\\r\\nand threes. A young man, pale, with nervous mouth, strongly-marked\\r\\nfeatures and clear dark eyes, looked up from a sheaf of letters which he\\r\\nwas busy sorting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t wait for me, Mr. Bullsom,\" he said. \"Reynolds will let me out,\\r\\nand I had better run through these letters before I leave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom was emphatic to the verge of gruffness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll do nothing of the sort,\" he declared. \"I tell you what it is,\\r\\nBrooks. We\\'re not going to let you knock yourself up. You\\'re tackling\\r\\nthis job in rare style. I can tell you that Henslow is delighted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m much obliged to you for saying so, Mr. Bullsom,\" the young man\\r\\nanswered. \"Of course the work is strange to me, but it is very\\r\\ninteresting, and I don\\'t mean to make a mess of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is only one chance of your doing that,\" Mr. Bullsom rejoined,\\r\\n\"and that is if you overwork yourself. You need a bit of looking after.\\r\\nYou\\'ve got a rare head on your shoulders, and I\\'m proud to think that I\\r\\nwas the one to bring your name before the committee. But I\\'m jolly well\\r\\ncertain of one thing. You\\'ve done all the work a man ought to do in one\\r\\nday. Now listen to me. Here\\'s my carriage waiting, and you\\'re going\\r\\nstraight home with me to have a bite and a glass of wine. We can\\'t\\r\\nafford to lose our second agent, and I can see what\\'s the matter with\\r\\nyou. You\\'re as pale as a ghost, and no wonder. You\\'ve been at it all\\r\\nday and never a break.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man called Brooks had not the energy to frame a refusal, which\\r\\nhe knew would be resented. He took down his overcoat, and stuffed the\\r\\nletters into his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re very good,\" he said. \"I\\'ll come up for an hour with pleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey passed out together into the street, and Mr. Bullsom opened the\\r\\ndoor of his carriage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In with you, young man,\" he exclaimed. \"Home, George!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKingston Brooks leaned back amongst the cushions with a little sigh of\\r\\nrelief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is very restful,\" he remarked. \"We have certainly had a very busy\\r\\nday. The inside of electioneering may be disenchanting, but it\\'s jolly\\r\\nhard work.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom sat with clasped hands in front of him resting upon that\\r\\nslight protuberance which denoted the advent of a stomach. He had\\r\\nthrown away the cigar which he had lit in the committee-room. Mrs.\\r\\nBullsom did not approve of smoking in the covered wagonette, which she\\r\\nfrequently honoured with her presence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s nothing in the world worth having that hasn\\'t to be worked for,\\r\\nmy boy,\" he declared, good-humoredly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By other people!\" Brooks remarked, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s as it may be,\" Mr. Bullsom admitted. \"To my mind that\\'s where\\r\\nthe art of the thing comes in. Any fool can work, but it takes a shrewd\\r\\nman to keep a lot of others working hard for him while he pockets the\\r\\noof himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose,\" the younger man remarked, thoughtfully, \"that you would\\r\\nconsider Mr. Henslow a shrewd man?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shrewd! Oh, Henslow\\'s shrewd enough. There\\'s no question about that!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And honest?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom hesitated. He drew his hand down his stubbly grey beard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Honest! Oh, yes, he\\'s honest! You\\'ve no fault to find with him, eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None whatever,\" Brooks hastened to say. \"You see,\" he continued more\\r\\nslowly, \"I have never been really behind the scenes in this sort of\\r\\nthing before, and Henslow has such a very earnest manner in speaking.\\r\\nHe talked to the working men last night as though his one desire in life\\r\\nwas to further the different radical schemes which we have on the\\r\\nprogramme. Why, the tears were actually in his eyes when he spoke of\\r\\nthe Old Age Pension Bill. He told them over and over again that the\\r\\npassing of that Bill was the one object of his political career. Then,\\r\\nyou know, there was the luncheon to-day--and I fancied that he was a\\r\\nlittle flippant about the labour vote. It was perhaps only his way of\\r\\nspeaking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom smiled and rubbed the carriage window with the cuff of his\\r\\ncoat. He was very hungry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, well, a politician has to trim a little, you know,\" he remarked.\\r\\n\"Votes he must have, and Henslow has a very good idea how to get them.\\r\\nHere we are, thank goodness.\" The carriage had turned up a short drive,\\r\\nand deposited them before the door of a highly ornate villa. Mr.\\r\\nBullsom led the way indoors, and himself took charge of his guest\\'s coat\\r\\nand hat. Then he opened the door of the drawing-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Bullsom and the girls,\" he remarked, urbanely, \"will be delighted\\r\\nto see you. Come in!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BULLSOM FAMILY AT HOME\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were fans upon the wall, and much bric-a-brac of Oriental shape\\r\\nbut Brummagem finish, a complete suite of drawing-room furniture,\\r\\nincandescent lights of fierce brilliancy, and a pianola. Mrs. Peter\\r\\nBullsom, stout and shiny in black silk and a chatelaine, was dozing\\r\\npeacefully in a chair, with the latest novel from the circulating\\r\\nlibrary in her lap; whilst her two daughters, in evening blouses, which\\r\\nwere somehow suggestive of the odd elevenpence, were engrossed in more\\r\\nserious occupation. Louise, the elder, whose budding resemblance to her\\r\\nmother was already a protection against the over-amorous youths of the\\r\\ntown, was reading a political speech in the Times. Selina, who had\\r\\nsandy hair, a slight figure, and was considered by her family the\\r\\nessence of refinement, was struggling with a volume of Cowper, who had\\r\\nbeen recommended to her by a librarian with a sense of humour, as a poet\\r\\nunlikely to bring a blush into her virginal cheeks. Mr. Bullsom\\r\\nlooked in upon his domestic circle with pardonable pride, and with a\\r\\nlittle flourish introduced his guest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Bullsom,\" he said, \"this is my young friend, Kingston Brooks. My\\r\\ntwo daughters, sir, Louise and Selina.\" The ladies were gracious, but\\r\\nhad the air of being taken by surprise, which, considering Mr.\\r\\nBullsom\\'s parting words a few hours ago, seemed strange.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ve had a great meeting,\" Mr. Bullsom remarked, sidling towards the\\r\\nhearthrug, and with his thumbs already stealing towards the armholes of\\r\\nhis waistcoat, \"a great meeting, my dears. Not that I am surprised!\\r\\nOh, no! As I said to Padgett, when he insisted that I should take the\\r\\nchair, \\'Padgett,\\' I said, \\'mark my words, we\\'re going to surprise the\\r\\ntown. Mr. Henslow may not be the most popular candidate we\\'ve ever\\r\\nhad, but he\\'s on the right side, and those who think Radicalism has had\\r\\nits day in Medchester will be amazed.\\' And so they have been. I\\'ve\\r\\ndropped a few hints during my speeches at the ward meetings lately, and\\r\\nMr. Brooks, though he\\'s new at the work, did his best, and I can tell\\r\\nyou the result was a marvel. The hall was packed--simply packed. When\\r\\nI rose to speak there wasn\\'t an empty place or chair to be seen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me!\" Mrs. Bullsom remarked, affably. \"Supper is quite ready, my\\r\\nlove.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom abandoned his position precipitately, and his face\\r\\nexpressed his lively satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed. \"I was hoping that you would have a bite for me.\\r\\nAs I said to Mr. Brooks when I asked him to drop in with me, there\\'s\\r\\nsure to be something to eat. And I can tell you I\\'m about ready for\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks found an opportunity to speak almost for the first time. He was\\r\\nstanding between the two Misses Bullsom, and already they had approved\\r\\nof him. He was distinctly of a different class from the casual visitors\\r\\nwhom their father was in the habit of introducing into the family\\r\\ncircle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bullsom was kind enough to take pity on an unfortunate bachelor,\"\\r\\nhe said, with a pleasant smile. \"My landlady has few faults, but an\\r\\nover-love of punctuality is one of them. By this time she and her\\r\\nhousehold are probably in bed. Our meeting lasted a long time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will touch the bell, Peter,\" Mrs. Bullsom remarked, \"Ann shall\\r\\ndish up the supper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young ladies exchanged shocked glances. \"Dish up.\" What an\\r\\nabominable phrase! They looked covertly at their guest, but his face\\r\\nwas imperturbable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We think that we have been very considerate, Mr. Brooks,\" Selina\\r\\nremarked, with an engaging smile. \"We gave up our usual dinner this\\r\\nevening as papa had to leave so early.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Brooks smiled as he offered his arm to Mrs. Bullsom--a courtesy\\r\\nwhich much embarrassed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think,\" he said, \"that we shall be able to show you some practical\\r\\nappreciation of your thoughtfulness. I know nothing so stimulating to\\r\\nthe appetite as politics, and to-day we have been so busy that I missed\\r\\neven my afternoon tea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sure that we are quite repaid for giving up our dinner,\" Selina\\r\\nremarked, with a backward glance at the young man. \"Oh, here you are at\\r\\nlast, Mary. I didn\\'t hear you come in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My niece, Miss Scott,\" Mr. Bullsom announced. \"Now you know all the\\r\\nfamily.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA plainly-dressed girl with dark eyes and unusually pale cheeks returned\\r\\nhis greeting quietly, and followed them into the dining-room. Mrs.\\r\\nBullsom spread herself over her seat with a little sigh of relief.\\r\\nBrooks gazed in silent wonder at the gilt-framed oleographs which hung\\r\\nthick upon the walls, and Mr. Bullsom stood up to carve a joint of\\r\\nbeef.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Plain fare, Mr. Brooks, for plain people,\" he remarked, gently\\r\\nelevating the sirloin on his fork, and determining upon a point of\\r\\nattack. \"We don\\'t understand frills here, but we\\'ve a welcome for our\\r\\nfriends, and a hearty one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If there is anything in the world better than roast beef,\" Brooks\\r\\nremarked, unfolding his serviette, \"I haven\\'t found it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s one thing,\" Mr. Bullsom remarked, pausing for a moment in his\\r\\nlabours, \"I can give you a good glass of wine. Ann, I think that if you\\r\\nlook in the right-hand drawer of the sideboard you will find a bottle of\\r\\nchampagne. If not I\\'ll have to go down into the cellar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnn, however, produced it--which, considering that Mr. Bullsom had\\r\\ncarefully placed it there a few hours ago, was not extraordinary--and\\r\\nBrooks sipped the wine with inward tremors, justified by the result.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose, Mr. Brooks,\" Selina remarked, turning towards him in an\\r\\nengaging fashion, \"that you are a great politician. I see your name so\\r\\nmuch in the papers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My political career,\" he answered, \"dates from yesterday morning. I am\\r\\ntaking Mr. Morrison\\'s place, you know, as agent for Mr. Henslow. I\\r\\nhave never done anything of the sort before, and I have scarcely any\\r\\nclaims to be considered a politician at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A very lucky change for us, Brooks,\" Mr. Bullsom declared, with the\\r\\nburly familiarity which he considered justified by his position as\\r\\nchairman of the Radical committee. \"Poor Morrison was past the job. It\\r\\nwas partly through his muddling that we lost the seat at the last\\r\\nelection. I\\'d made up my mind to have a change this time, and so I told\\r\\n\\'em.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks was tired of politics, and he looked across the table. This\\r\\npale girl with the tired eyes and self-contained manner interested him.\\r\\nThe difference, too, between her and the rest of the family was\\r\\npuzzling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe, Miss Scott,\" he said, \"that I met you at the Stuarts\\'\\r\\ndance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was there,\" she admitted. \"I don\\'t think I danced with you, but we\\r\\nhad supper at the same table.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I remember it perfectly,\" he said. \"Wasn\\'t it supposed to be a very\\r\\ngood dance?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe so,\" she answered. \"There was the usual fault--too many\\r\\ngirls. But it was very pretty to watch.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do not care for dancing, yourself, perhaps?\" he hazarded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I do,\" she declared. \"But I knew scarcely any one there. I see\\r\\na good deal of Kate sometimes, but the others I scarcely know at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You were in the same position as I was, then,\" he answered, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you--you are different,\" she remarked. \"I mean that you are a man,\\r\\nand at a dance that means everything. That is why I rather dislike\\r\\ndances. We are too dependent upon you. If you would only let us dance\\r\\nalone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina smiled in a superior manner. She would have given a good deal to\\r\\nhave been invited to the dance in question, but that was a matter which\\r\\nshe did not think it worth while to mention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mary!\" she said, \"what an idea. I am quite sure that when you\\r\\ngo out with us you need never have any difficulty about partners.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our programmes for the Liberal Club Dance and the County Cricket Ball\\r\\nwere full before we had been in the room five minutes,\" Louise\\r\\ninterposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary smiled inwardly, but said nothing, and Brooks was quite sure then\\r\\nthat she was different. He realized too that her teeth were perfect,\\r\\nand her complexion, notwithstanding its pallor, was faultless. She\\r\\nwould have been strikingly good-looking but for her mouth, and that--was\\r\\nit a discontented or a supercilious curl? At any rate it disappeared\\r\\nwhen she smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I ask whether you have been attending a political meeting this\\r\\nevening, Miss Scott?\" he asked. \"You came in after us, I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I have a class on Wednesday evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A class!\" he repeated, doubtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom, who thought he had been out of the conversation long\\r\\nenough, interposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary calls herself a bit of a philanthropist, you see, Mr. Brooks,\" he\\r\\nexplained. \"Goes down into Medchester and teaches factory girls to play\\r\\nthe piano on Wednesday evenings. Much good may it do them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a curious gleam in the girl\\'s eyes for a moment which checked\\r\\nthe words on Brooks\\' lips, and led him to precipitately abandon the\\r\\nconversation. But afterwards, while Selina was pedalling at the pianola\\r\\nand playing havoc with the expression-stops, he crossed the room and\\r\\nstood for a moment by her chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like you to tell me about your class,\" he said. \"I have\\r\\nseveral myself--of different sorts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe closed her magazine, but left her finger in the place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, mine is a very unambitious undertaking,\" she said. \"Kate Stuart\\r\\nand I started it for the girls in her father\\'s factory, and we aim at\\r\\nnothing higher than an attempt to direct their taste in fiction. They\\r\\nbring their Free Library lists to us, and we mark them together. Then\\r\\nwe all read one more serious book at the same time--history or\\r\\nbiography--and talk about it when we meet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is an excellent idea,\" he said, earnestly. \"By the bye, something\\r\\noccurs to me. You know, or rather you don\\'t know, that I give free\\r\\nlectures on certain books or any simple literary subject on Wednesday\\r\\nevenings at the Secular Hall when this electioneering isn\\'t on.\\r\\nCouldn\\'t you bring your girls one evening? I would be guided in my\\r\\nchoice of a subject by you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I should like that,\" she answered, \"and I think the girls would.\\r\\nIt is very good of you to suggest it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLouise, with a great book under her arm, deposited her dumpy person in a\\r\\nseat by his side, and looked up at him with a smile of engaging candour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Brooks,\" she said, \"I am going to do a terrible thing. I am going\\r\\nto show you some of my sketches and ask your opinion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks turned towards her without undue enthusiasm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very good of you, Miss Bullsom,\" he said, doubtfully; \"but I\\r\\nnever drew a straight line in my life, and I know nothing whatever about\\r\\nperspective. My opinion would be worse than worthless.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLouise giggled artlessly, and turned over the first few pages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You men all say that at first,\" she declared, \"and then you turn out\\r\\nsuch terrible critics. I declare I\\'m afraid to show them to you, after\\r\\nall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks scarcely showed that desire to overcome her new resolution which\\r\\npoliteness demanded. But Selina came tripping across the room, and took\\r\\nup her position on the other side of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must show them now you\\'ve brought them out, Louise,\" she declared.\\r\\n\"I am sure that Mr. Brooks\\' advice will be most valuable. But mind, if\\r\\nyou dare to show mine, I\\'ll tear them into pieces.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wasn\\'t going to, dear,\" Louise declared, a little tartly. \"Shall I\\r\\nbegin at the beginning, Mr. Brooks, or--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, don\\'t show those first few, dear,\" Selina exclaimed. \"You know\\r\\nthey\\'re not nearly so good as some of the others. That mill is all out\\r\\nof drawing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, who had been elbowed into the background, rose quietly and crossed\\r\\nto the other end of the room. Brooks followed her for a moment with\\r\\nregretful eyes. Her simple gown, with the little piece of ribbon around\\r\\nher graceful neck, seemed almost distinguished by comparison with the\\r\\nloud-patterned and dressier blouses of the two girls who had now hemmed\\r\\nhim in. For a moment he ignored the waiting pages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your cousin,\" he remarked, \"is quite unlike any of you. Has she been\\r\\nwith you long?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLouise looked up a little tartly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, about three years. You are quite right when you say that she is\\r\\nunlike any of us. It doesn\\'t seem nice to complain about her exactly,\\r\\nbut she really is terribly trying, isn\\'t she, Selina?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina nodded, and dropped her voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is getting worse,\" she declared. \"She is becoming a positive\\r\\ntrouble to us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks endeavoured to look properly sympathetic, and considered himself\\r\\njustified in pursuing the conversation. \"Indeed! May I ask in what\\r\\nway?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, she has such old-fashioned ideas,\" Louise said, confidentially.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve quite lost patience with her, and so has Selina; haven\\'t you,\\r\\ndear? She never goes to parties if she can help it, she is positively\\r\\nrude to all our friends, and the sarcastic things she says sometimes are\\r\\nmost unpleasant. You know, papa is very, very good to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" Selina interrupted. \"You know, Mr. Brooks, she has no\\r\\nfather and mother, and she was living quite alone in London when papa\\r\\nfound her out and brought her here--and in the most abject poverty. I\\r\\nbelieve he found her in a garret. Fancy that!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now,\" Louise continued, \"he allows her for her clothes exactly the\\r\\nsame as he does us--and look at her. Would you believe it, now? She is\\r\\nlike that nearly every evening, although we have friends dropping in\\r\\ncontinually. Of course I don\\'t believe in extravagance, but if a girl\\r\\nhas relations who are generous enough to give her the means, I do think\\r\\nthat, for their sake, she ought to dress properly. I think that she\\r\\nowes it to them, as well as to herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And out of doors it is positively worse,\" Selina whispered,\\r\\nimpressively. \"I declare,\" she added, with a simper, \"that although\\r\\nnobody can say that I am proud, there are times when I am positively\\r\\nashamed to be seen out with her. What she does with her money I can\\'t\\r\\nimagine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks, who was something of a critic in such matters, and had\\r\\nrecognized the art of her severely simple gown, smiled to himself. He\\r\\nwas wise enough, however, not to commit himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" he suggested, \"she thinks that absolute simplicity suits her\\r\\nbest. She has a nice figure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina tossed her much-beaded slipper impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heaven only knows what Mary does think,\" she exclaimed, impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Heaven only knows what I am to say about these,\" Brooks groaned\\r\\ninwardly, as the sketch-book fell open before him at last, and its\\r\\ncontents were revealed to his astonished eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\nKINGSTON BROOKS HAS A VISITOR\\r\\n\\r\\nKingston Brooks was twenty-five years old, strong, nervous, and with a\\r\\nstrenuous desire to make his way so far as was humanly possible into the\\r\\nheart of life. He was a young solicitor recently established in\\r\\nMedchester, without friends save those he was now making, and absolutely\\r\\nwithout interest of any sort. He had a small capital, and already the\\r\\nbeginnings of a practice. He had some sort of a reputation as a\\r\\nspeaker, and was well spoken of by those who had entrusted business to\\r\\nhim. Yet he was still fighting for a living when this piece of luck had\\r\\nbefallen him. Mr. Bullsom had entrusted a small case to him, and found\\r\\nhim capable and cheap. Amongst that worthy gentleman\\'s chief\\r\\ncharacteristics was a decided weakness for patronizing younger and less\\r\\nsuccessful men, and he went everywhere with Kingston Brooks\\' name on his\\r\\nlips. Then came the election, and the sudden illness of Mr. Morrison,\\r\\nwho had always acted as agent for the Radical candidates for the\\r\\nborough. Another agent had to be found. Several who would have been\\r\\nsuitable were unavailable. An urgent committee meeting was held, and\\r\\nMr. Bullsom at once called attention to an excellent little speech of\\r\\nKingston Brooks\\' at a ward meeting on the previous night. In an hour he\\r\\nwas closeted with the young lawyer, and the affair was settled. Brooks\\r\\nknew that henceforth the material side of his career would be\\r\\ncomparatively easy sailing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had accepted his good fortune with something of the same cheerful\\r\\nphilosophy with which he had seen difficulty loom up in his path a few\\r\\nmonths ago. But to-night, on his way home from Mr. Bullsom\\'s suburban\\r\\nresidence, a different mood possessed him. Usually a self-contained and\\r\\nsomewhat gravely minded person, to-night the blood went tingling through\\r\\nhis veins with a new and unaccustomed warmth. He carried himself\\r\\nblithely, the cool night air was so grateful and sweet to him that he\\r\\nhad no mind even to smoke. There seemed to be no tangible reason for\\r\\nthe change. The political excitement, which a few weeks ago he had\\r\\nbegun to feel exhilarating, had for him decreased now that his share in\\r\\nit lay behind the scenes, and he found himself wholly occupied with the\\r\\npurely routine work of the election. Nor was there any sufficient\\r\\nexplanation to be found in the entertainment which he had felt himself\\r\\nbound to accept at Mr. Bullsom\\'s hands. Of the wine, which had been\\r\\nonly tolerable, he had drunk, as was his custom, sparingly, and of Mary\\r\\nScott, who had certainly interested him in a manner which the rest of\\r\\nthe family had not, he had after all seen but very little. He found\\r\\nhimself thinking with fervor of the desirable things in life, never had\\r\\nthe various tasks which he had set himself seemed so easy an\\r\\naccomplishment, his own powers more real and alive. And beneath it all\\r\\nhe was conscious of a vague sense of excitement, a nervous dancing of\\r\\nthe blood, as though even now the time were at hand when he might find\\r\\nhimself in touch with some of the greater forces of life, all of which\\r\\nhe intended some day to realize. It was delightful after all to be\\r\\nyoung and strong, to be stripped for the race in the morning of life,\\r\\nwhen every indrawn breath seems sweet with the perfume of beautiful\\r\\nthings, and the heart is tuned to music.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fatigue of the day was wholly forgotten. He was surprised indeed\\r\\nwhen he found himself in the little street where his rooms were. A\\r\\nsmall brougham was standing at the corner, the liveries and horse of\\r\\nwhich, though quiet enough, caused him a moment\\'s surprise as being\\r\\nsuperior to the ordinary equipages of the neighborhood. He passed on\\r\\nto the sober-fronted house where he lived, and entering with his\\r\\nlatch-key made his way to his study. Immediately he entered he was\\r\\nconscious of a man comfortably seated in his easy-chair, and apparently\\r\\nengrossed in a magazine.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe advanced towards him inquiringly, and his visitor, carefully setting\\r\\ndown the magazine, rose slowly to his feet. The young man\\'s surprise at\\r\\nfinding his rooms occupied was increased by the appearance of his\\r\\nvisitor. He was apparently of more than middle age, with deeply-lined\\r\\nface, tall, and with an expression the coldness of which was only\\r\\nslightly mitigated by a sensitive mouth that seemed at once cynical and\\r\\nhumorous. He was of more than ordinary height, and dressed in the\\r\\nplainest dinner garb of the day, but his dinner jacket, his black tie\\r\\nand the set of his shirt were revelations to Brooks, who dealt only\\r\\nwith the Medchester tradespeople. He did not hold out his hand, but he\\r\\neyed Brooks with a sort of critical survey, which the latter found a\\r\\nlittle disconcerting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You wished to see me, sir?\" Brooks asked. \"My name is Kingston Brooks,\\r\\nand these are my rooms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I understood,\" the new-comer replied imperturbably. \"I called about\\r\\nan hour ago, and took the liberty of awaiting your return.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks sat down. His vis-a-vis was calmly selecting a cigarette from a\\r\\ncapacious case. Brooks found himself offering a light and accepting a\\r\\ncigarette himself, the flavour of which he at once appreciated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can I offer you a whisky-and-soda?\" he inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thank you, no,\" was the quiet reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a short pause.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You wished to see me on some business connected with the election, no\\r\\ndoubt?\" Brooks suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis visitor shook his head slowly. He knocked the ash from his\\r\\ncigarette and smiled whimsically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear fellow,\" he said, \"I haven\\'t the least idea why I came to see\\r\\nyou this evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks felt that he had a right to be puzzled, and he looked it. But\\r\\nhis visitor was so evidently a gentleman and a person of account, that\\r\\nthe obvious rejoinder did not occur to him. He merely waited with\\r\\nuplifted eyebrows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not the least idea,\" his visitor repeated, still smiling. \"But at the\\r\\nsame time I fancy that before I leave you I shall find myself\\r\\nexplaining, or endeavouring to explain, not why I am here, but why I\\r\\nhave not visited you before. What do you think of that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I find it,\" Brooks answered, \"enigmatic but interesting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly. Well, I hate talking, so my explanation will not be a tedious\\r\\none. Your name is Kingston Brooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your mother\\'s name was Dorothy Kenneir. She was, before her marriage,\\r\\nthe matron of a home in the East End of London, and a lady devoted to\\r\\nphilanthropic work. Your father was a police-court missionary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks was leaning a little forward in his chair. These things were\\r\\ntrue enough. Who was his visitor?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your father, through over-devotion to the philanthropic works in which\\r\\nhe was engaged, lost his reason temporarily, and on his partial recovery\\r\\nI understand that the doctors considered him still to be mentally in a\\r\\nvery weak state. They ordered him a sea voyage. He left England on the\\r\\nCorinthia fifteen years ago, and I believe that you heard nothing more\\r\\nof him until you received the news of his death--probably ten years\\r\\nback.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes! Ten years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your mother, I think, lived for only a few months after your father\\r\\nleft England. You found a guardian in Mr. Ascough of Lincoln\\'s Inn\\r\\nFields. There my knowledge of your history ceases.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you know these things?\" Brooks asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was with your father when he died. It was I who wrote to you and\\r\\nsent his effects to England.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You were there--in Canada?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. I had a dwelling within a dozen miles of where your father had\\r\\nbuilt his hut by the side of the great lake. He was the only other\\r\\nEnglishman within a hundred miles. So I was with him often.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is wonderful--after all these years,\" Brooks exclaimed. \"You were\\r\\nthere for sport, of course?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For sport!\" his visitor repeated in a colourless tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But my father--what led him there? Why did he cut himself off from\\r\\nevery one, send no word home, creep away into that lone country to die\\r\\nby himself? It is horrible to think of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your father was not a communicative man. He spoke of his illness. I\\r\\nalways considered him as a person mentally shattered. He spent his days\\r\\nalone, looking out across the lake or wandering in the woods. He had no\\r\\ncompanions, of course, but there were always animals around him. He had\\r\\nthe look of a man who had suffered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was to have gone to Australia,\" Brooks said. \"It was from there\\r\\nthat we expected news from him. I cannot see what possible reason he\\r\\nhad for changing his plans. There was no mystery about his life in\\r\\nLondon. It was one splendid record of self-denial and devotion to what\\r\\nhe thought his duty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From what he told me,\" his vis-a-vis continued, handing again his\\r\\ncigarette-case, and looking steadily into the fire, \"he seems to have\\r\\nleft England with the secret determination never to return. But why I\\r\\ndo not know. One thing is certain. His mental state was not altogether\\r\\nhealthy. His desire for solitude was almost a passion. Towards the\\r\\nend, however, his mind was clear enough. He told me about your mother\\r\\nand you, and he handed me all the papers, which I subsequently sent to\\r\\nLondon. He spoke of no trouble, and his transition was quite peaceful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a cruel ending,\" Brooks said, quietly. \"There were people in\\r\\nLondon whom he had befriended who would have worked their passage out\\r\\nand faced any hardships to be with him. And my mother, notwithstanding\\r\\nhis desertion, believed in him to the last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a moment\\'s intense silence. This visitor who had come so\\r\\nstrangely was to all appearance a man not easily to be moved. Yet\\r\\nBrooks fancied that the long white fingers were trembling, and that the\\r\\nstrange quiet of his features was one of intense self-repression. His\\r\\ntone when he spoke again, however, was clear, and almost indifferent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I feel,\" he said, \"that it would have been only decently courteous of\\r\\nme to have sought you out before, although I have, as you see, nothing\\r\\nwhatever to add to the communications I sent you. But I have not been a\\r\\nvery long time in England, and I have a very evil habit of putting off\\r\\nthings concerning which there is no urgency. I called at Ascough\\'s, and\\r\\nlearned that you were in practice in Medchester. I am now living for a\\r\\nshort time not far from here, and reading of the election, I drove in\\r\\nto-night to attend one of the meetings--I scarcely cared which. I heard\\r\\nyour name, saw you on the platform, and called here, hoping to find\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was very kind,\" Brooks said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe felt curiously tongue-tied. This sudden upheaval of a past which he\\r\\nhad never properly understood affected him strangely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I gathered from Mr. Ascough that you were left sufficient means to pay\\r\\nfor your education, and also to start you in life,\" his visitor\\r\\ncontinued. \"Yours is considered to be an overcrowded profession, but I\\r\\nam glad to understand that you seem likely to make your way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks thanked him absently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From your position on the platform to-night I gather that you are a\\r\\npolitician?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Scarcely that,\" Brooks answered. \"I was fortunate enough to be\\r\\nappointed agent to Mr. Henslow owing to the illness of another man. It\\r\\nwill help me in my profession.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visitor rose to his feet. He stood with his hands behind him,\\r\\nlooking at the younger man. And Brooks suddenly remembered that he did\\r\\nnot even know his name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will forgive me,\" he said, also rising, \"if I have seemed a little\\r\\ndazed. I am very grateful to you for coming. I have always wanted more\\r\\nthan anything in the world to meet some one who saw my father after he\\r\\nleft England. There is so much which even now seems mysterious with\\r\\nregard to his disappearance from the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I fear that you will never discover more than you have done from me,\"\\r\\nwas the quiet reply. \"Your father had been living for years in profound\\r\\nsolitude when I found him. Frankly, I considered from the first that\\r\\nhis mind was unhinged. Therein I fancy lies the whole explanation of\\r\\nhis silence and his voluntary disappearance. I am assuming, of course,\\r\\nthat there was nothing in England to make his absence desirable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was nothing,\" Brooks declared with conviction. \"That I can\\r\\npersonally vouch for. His life as a police-court missionary was the\\r\\nlife of a militant martyr\\'s, the life of a saint. The urgent advice of\\r\\nhis physicians alone led him to embark upon that voyage; I see now that\\r\\nit was a mistake. He left before he had sufficiently recovered to be\\r\\nsafely trusted alone. By the bye,\" Brooks continued, after a moment\\'s\\r\\nhesitation, \"you have not told me your name, whom I have to thank for\\r\\nthis kindness. Your letters from Canada were not signed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a short silence. From outside came the sound of the pawing\\r\\nof horses\\' feet and the jingling of harness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was a fellow-traveller in that great unpeopled world,\" the visitor\\r\\nsaid, \"and there was nothing but common humanity in anything I did. I\\r\\nlived out there as Philip Ferringshaw, here I have to add my title, the\\r\\nMarquis of Arranmore. I was a younger son in those days. If there is\\r\\nanything which I have forgotten, I am at Enton for a month or so. It is\\r\\nan easy walk from Medchester, if your clients can spare you for an\\r\\nafternoon. Good-night, Mr. Brooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held out his hand. He was sleepy apparently, for his voice had\\r\\nbecome almost a drawl, and he stifled a yawn as he passed along the\\r\\nlittle passage. Kingston Brooks returned to his little room, and threw\\r\\nhimself back into his easy-chair. Truly this had been a wonderful day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nA QUESTION FOR THE COUNTRY\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time in many years it seemed certain that the\\r\\nConservatives had lost their hold upon the country. The times were ripe\\r\\nfor a change of any sort. An ill-conducted and ruinous war had drained\\r\\nthe empire of its surplus wealth, and every known industry was suffering\\r\\nfrom an almost paralyzing depression--Medchester, perhaps, as severely\\r\\nas any town in the United Kingdom. Its staple manufactures were being\\r\\nimported from the States and elsewhere at prices which the local\\r\\nmanufacturers declared to be ruinous. Many of the largest factories\\r\\nwere standing idle, a great majority of the remainder were being worked\\r\\nat half or three-quarters time. Thoughtful men, looking ten years\\r\\nahead, saw the cloud, which even now was threatening enough, grow\\r\\nblacker and blacker, and shuddered at the thought of the tempest which\\r\\nbefore long must break over the land. Meanwhile, the streets were\\r\\nfilled with unemployed, whose demeanour day by day grew less and less\\r\\npacific. People asked one another helplessly what was being done to\\r\\navert the threatened crisis. The manufacturers, openly threatened by\\r\\ntheir discharged employees, and cajoled by others higher in authority and\\r\\nby public opinion, still pronounced themselves helpless to move without\\r\\nthe aid of legislation. For the first time for years Protection was\\r\\nopenly spoken of from a political platform.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenslow, a shrewd man and a politician of some years\\' standing, was one\\r\\nof the first to read the signs of the times, and rightly to appreciate\\r\\nthem. He had just returned from a lengthened visit to the United\\r\\nStates, and what he had seen there he kept at first very much to\\r\\nhimself. But at a small committee meeting held when his election was\\r\\nstill a matter of doubt, he unbosomed himself at last to some effect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The vote we want,\" he said, \"is the vote of those people who are losing\\r\\ntheir bread, and who see ruin and starvation coming in upon them. I\\r\\nmean the middle-class manufacturers and the operatives who are dependent\\r\\nupon them. I tell you where I think that as a nation we are going\\r\\nwrong. We fixed once upon a great principle, and we nailed it to our\\r\\nmast--for all time. That is a mistake. Absolute Free Trade, such as is\\r\\nat present our national policy, was a magnificent principle in the days\\r\\nof Cobden--but the times have changed. We must change with them. That\\r\\nis where the typical Englishman fails. It is a matter of temperament.\\r\\nHe is too slow to adapt himself to changing circumstances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a moment\\'s silence. These were ominous words. Every one felt\\r\\nthat they were not lightly spoken. Henslow had more behind. A\\r\\nprominent manufacturer, Harrison by name, interposed from his place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are aware, Mr. Henslow,\" he said, \"that many a man has lost an\\r\\nassured seat for a more guarded speech than that. For generations even\\r\\na whisper of the sort has been counted heresy--especially from our\\r\\nparty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Maybe,\" Henslow answered, \"but I am reminded of this, Mr. Harrison.\\r\\nThe pioneers of every great social change have suffered throughout the\\r\\nwhole of history, but the man who has selected the proper moment and\\r\\nstruck hard, has never failed to win his reward. Now I am no novice in\\r\\npolitics, and I am going to make a prophecy. Years ago the two\\r\\npolitical parties were readjusted on the Irish question. Every election\\r\\nwhich was fought was simply on these lines--it was upon the principle of\\r\\nHome Rule for Ireland, and the severance of that country from the United\\r\\nKingdom, or the maintenance of the Union. Good! Now, in more recent\\r\\ntimes, the South African war and the realization of what our Colonies\\r\\ncould do for us has introduced a new factor. Those who have believed in\\r\\na doctrine of expansion have called themselves \\'Imperialists,\\' and those\\r\\nwho have favoured less wide-reaching ideals, and perhaps more attention\\r\\nto home matters, have been christened \\'Little Englanders.\\' Many\\r\\nelections have been fought out on these lines, if not between two men\\r\\nabsolutely at variance with one another on this question, still on the\\r\\nmatter of degree. Now, I am going to prophesy. I say that the next\\r\\nreadjustment of Parties, and the time is not far ahead, will be on the\\r\\ntariff question, and I believe that the controversy on this matter, when\\r\\nonce the country has laid hold of it, will be the greatest political\\r\\nevent of this century. Listen, gentlemen. I do not speak without\\r\\nhaving given this question careful and anxious thought, and I tell you\\r\\nthat I can see it coming.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe committee meeting broke up at a late hour in the afternoon amidst\\r\\nsome excitement, and Mr. Bullsom walked back to his office with Brooks.\\r\\nA fine rain was falling, and the two men were close together under one\\r\\numbrella.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you think of it, Brooks?\" Bullsom asked anxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To tell you the truth, I scarcely know,\" the younger answered. \"Ten\\r\\nyears ago there could have been but one answer--to-day--well, look\\r\\nthere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two men stood still for a moment. They were in the centre of the\\r\\ntown, at a spot from which the main thoroughfares radiated into the\\r\\nsuburbs and manufacturing centres. Everywhere the pavements and the\\r\\nopen space where a memorial tower stood were crowded with loiterers.\\r\\nMen in long lines stood upon the kerbstones, their hands in their\\r\\npockets, watching, waiting--God knows for what. There were all sorts,\\r\\nof course, the professional idlers and the drunkard were there, but the\\r\\nothers--there was no lack of them. There was no lack of men,\\r\\nwhite-faced, dull-eyed, dejected, some of them actually with the brand of\\r\\nstarvation to be seen in their sunken cheeks and wasted limbs. No\\r\\nwonder that the swing-doors of the public-houses, where there was light\\r\\nand warmth inside, opened and shut continually.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look,\" Brooks repeated, with a tremor in his tone. \"There are\\r\\nthousands and thousands of them--and all of them must have some sort of\\r\\na home to go to. Fancy it--one\\'s womankind, perhaps children--and\\r\\nnothing to take home to them. It\\'s such an old story, that it sounds\\r\\nhackneyed and commonplace. But God knows there\\'s no other tragedy on\\r\\nHis earth like it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom was uncomfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve given a hundred pounds to the Unemployed Fund,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s money well spent if it had been a thousand,\" Brooks answered.\\r\\n\"Some day they may learn their strength, and they will not suffer then,\\r\\nlike brute animals, in silence. Look here. I\\'m going to speak to one\\r\\nof them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe touched a tall youth on the shoulder. \"Out of work, my lad?\" he\\r\\nasked. The youth turned surlily round. \"Yes. Looks like it, don\\'t\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you?\" Brooks asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Clicker.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you leave your last place?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gaffer said he\\'s no more orders--couldn\\'t keep us on. The shop\\'s shut\\r\\nup. Know of a job, guv\\'nor?\" he asked, with a momentary eagerness.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve two characters in my pocket--good \\'uns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ve tried to get a place elsewhere?\" Brooks asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tried? D\\'ye suppose I\\'m standing here for fun? I\\'ve tramped the\\r\\nblessed town. I went to thirty factories yesterday, and forty to-day.\\r\\nKnow of a job, guv\\'nor? I\\'m not particular.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I did,\" Brooks answered, simply. \"Here\\'s half-a-crown. Go to\\r\\nthat coffee-palace over there and get a meal. It\\'s all I can do for\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good for you, guv\\'nor,\" was the prompt answer. \"I can treat my brother\\r\\non that. Here, Ned,\" he caught hold of a younger boy by the shoulder,\\r\\n\"hot coffee and eggs, you sinner. Come on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two scurried off together. Brooks and his companion passed on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is just this,\" Brooks said, in a low tone, \"just the thought of\\r\\nthese people makes me afraid, positively afraid to argue with Henslow.\\r\\nYou see--he may be right. I tell you that in a healthily-governed\\r\\ncountry there should be work for every man who is able and willing to\\r\\nwork. And in England there isn\\'t. Free Trade works out all right\\r\\nlogically, but it\\'s one thing to see it all on paper, and it\\'s another\\r\\nto see this--here around us--and Medchester isn\\'t the worst off by any\\r\\nmeans.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBullsom was silent for several moments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you what it is, Brooks,\" he said. \"I\\'ll send another hundred to\\r\\nthe Unemployed Fund to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s generous of you, Mr. Bullsom,\" the young lawyer answered.\\r\\n\"You\\'ll never regret it. But look here. There\\'s a greater\\r\\nresponsibility even than feeding these poor fellows resting upon us\\r\\nto-day. They don\\'t want our charity. They\\'ve an equal right to live\\r\\nwith us. What they want, and what they have a right to, is just\\r\\nlegislation. That\\'s where we come in. Politics isn\\'t a huge joke, or\\r\\nthe vehicle for any one man\\'s personal ambition. We who interest\\r\\nourselves, however remotely, in them, impose upon ourselves a great\\r\\nobligation. We\\'ve got to find the truth. That\\'s why I hesitate to say\\r\\nanything against Henslow\\'s new departure. We\\'re off the track now. I\\r\\nwant to hear all that Henslow has to say. We must not neglect a single\\r\\nchance whilst that terrible cry is ever in our ears.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey parted at the tram terminus, Mr. Bullsom taking a car for his\\r\\nsuburban paradise. As usual, he was the centre of a little group of\\r\\nacquaintances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how goes the election, Bullsom?\" some one asked him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom was in no hurry to answer the question. He glanced round\\r\\nthe car, collecting the attention of those who might be supposed\\r\\ninterested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will answer that question better,\" he said, \"after the mass meeting\\r\\non Saturday night. I think that Henslow\\'s success or failure will\\r\\ndepend on that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Got something up your sleeve, eh?\" his first questioner remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Maybe,\" Mr. Bullsom answered. \"Maybe not. But apart from the\\r\\nimmediate matter of this election, I can tell you one thing, gentlemen,\\r\\nwhich may interest you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused. One thumb stole towards the armhole of his waistcoat. He\\r\\nliked to see these nightly companions of his hang upon his words. It\\r\\nwas a proper and gratifying tribute to his success as a man of affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have just left,\" he said, \"our future Member.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe significance of his speech was not immediately apparent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Henslow! Oh, yes. Committee meeting this afternoon, wasn\\'t it?\" some\\r\\none remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not mean Henslow,\" Mr. Bullsom replied. \"I mean Kingston\\r\\nBrooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe desired sensation was apparent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, he\\'s your new agent, isn\\'t he?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Young fellow who plays cricket rather well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Great golfer, they say!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Makes a good speech, some one was saying.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gives free lectures at the Secular Hall.\" \"Rather a smart young\\r\\nsolicitor, they say!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom looked around him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is all these things, and he does all these things. He is one of\\r\\nthese youngsters who has the knack of doing everything well. Mark my\\r\\nwords, all of you. I gave him his first case of any importance, and I\\r\\ngot him this job as agent for Henslow. He\\'s bound to rise. He\\'s\\r\\nambitious, and he\\'s got the brains. He\\'ll be M.P. for this borough\\r\\nbefore we know where we are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf-a-dozen men of more or less importance made a mental note to nod to\\r\\nKingston Brooks next time they saw him, and Mr. Bullsom trudged up his\\r\\navenue with fresh schemes maturing in his mind. In the domestic circle\\r\\nhe further unburdened himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Bullsom,\" he said, \"I am thinking of giving a dinner-party. How\\r\\nmany people do we know better than ourselves?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bullsom was aghast, and the young ladies, Selina and Louise, who\\r\\nwere in the room, were indignant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, papa,\" Selina exclaimed, \"what do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What I say,\" he answered, gruffly. \"We\\'re plain people, your mother\\r\\nand I, at any rate, and when you come to reckon things up, I suppose\\r\\nyou\\'ll admit that we\\'re not much in the social way. There\\'s plenty of\\r\\npeople living round us in a sight smaller houses who don\\'t know us, and\\r\\nwouldn\\'t if they could--and I\\'m not so sure that it\\'s altogether the\\r\\nfault of your father and mother either, Selina,\" he added, breaking\\r\\nruthlessly in upon a sotto-voce remark of that young lady\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I never!\" Selina exclaimed, tossing her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, come, I don\\'t want no sauce from you girls,\" he added, drifting\\r\\ntowards the fireplace, and adopting a more assured tone as he reached\\r\\nhis favourite position. \"I\\'ve reasons for wishing to have Mr. Kingston\\r\\nBrooks here, and I\\'d like him to meet gentlefolk. Now, there\\'s the\\r\\nVicar and his wife. Do you suppose they\\'d come?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I should like to know why not,\" Mrs. Bullsom remarked, laying\\r\\ndown her knitting, \"when it\\'s only three weeks ago you sent him ten\\r\\nguineas for the curates\\' fund. Come indeed! They\\'d better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then there\\'s Dr. Seventon,\" Mr. Bullsom continued, \"and his wife.\\r\\nBetter drop him a line and tell him to look in and see me at the office.\\r\\nI can invent something the matter with me, and I\\'d best drop him a hint.\\r\\nThey say Mrs. Seventon is exclusive. But I\\'ll just let him know she\\'s\\r\\ngot to come. Now, who else, girls?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Huntingdons might come--if they knew that it was this sort of an\\r\\naffair,\" Selina remarked, thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Mr. Seaton,\" Louise added. \"I\\'m sure he\\'s most gentlemanly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want gentlemanly people this time,\" Mr. Bullsom declared, \"I\\r\\nwant gentle-people. That\\'s all there is about it. I let you ask who\\r\\nyou like to the house, and give you what you want for subscriptions and\\r\\nclothes and such-like. You\\'ve had a free \\'and. Now let\\'s see something\\r\\nfor it. Half-a-dozen couples\\'ll be enough if you can\\'t get more, but I\\r\\nWon\\'t have the Nortons, or the Marvises, or any of that podgy set. You\\r\\nunderstand that? And, first of all, you, Selina, had better write to\\r\\nMr. Brooks and ask him to dine with us in a friendly way one night the\\r\\nweek after next, when the election is over and done with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In a friendly way, pa?\" Selina repeated, doubtfully. \"But we can\\'t ask\\r\\nthese other people whom we know so slightly like that--and, besides, Mr.\\r\\nBrooks might not dress if we put it like that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A nice lot you know about gentle-people and their ways,\" Mr. Bullsom\\r\\nremarked, with scorn. \"A young fellow like Brooks would tog himself out\\r\\nfor dinner all right even if we were alone, as long as there were ladies\\r\\nthere. And as for the dinner, you don\\'t suppose I\\'m such a mug as to\\r\\nleave that to Ann. I shall go to the Queen\\'s Hotel, and have \\'em send a\\r\\ncook and waiters, and run the whole show. Don\\'t know that I shan\\'t send\\r\\nto London. You get the people! I\\'ll feed \\'em!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do as your father says, Selina,\" Mrs. Bullsom said, mildly. \"I\\'m sure\\r\\nhe\\'s very considerate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'s Mary?\" Mr. Bullsom inquired. \"This is a bit in her line.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina tossed her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sure I don\\'t know why you should say that, papa,\" she declared.\\r\\n\"Mary knows nothing about society, and she has no friends who would be\\r\\nthe least use to us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is she, anyway?\" Mr. Bullsom demanded. No one knew. As a matter\\r\\nof fact she was having tea with Kingston Brooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MARQUIS OF ARRANMORE\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had met almost on the steps of his office, and only a few minutes\\r\\nafter he had left Mr. Bullsom. Brooks was attracted first by a certain\\r\\nsense of familiarity with the trim, well-balanced figure, and\\r\\nimmediately afterwards she raised her eyes to his in passing. He\\r\\nwheeled sharply round, and held out his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Scott, isn\\'t it? Do you know I have just left your uncle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled a little absently. She looked tired, and her boots and skirt\\r\\nwere splashed as though with much walking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed! I suppose you see a good deal of him just now while the\\r\\nelection is on?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must make myself a perfect nuisance to him,\" Brooks admitted. \"You\\r\\nsee the work is all new to me, and he has been through it many times\\r\\nbefore. Are you just going home?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been out since two o\\'clock,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you are almost wet through, and quite tired out,\" he said. \"Look\\r\\nhere. Come across to Mellor\\'s and have some tea with me, and I will put\\r\\nyou in a car afterwards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated--and he led the way across the Street, giving her no\\r\\nopportunity to frame a refusal. The little tea-place was warm and cosy.\\r\\nHe found a comfortable corner, and took her wet umbrella and cape away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe,\" he said, sitting down opposite her, \"that I have saved your\\r\\nlife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I am not sure,\" she answered, \"that I feel grateful to you. I\\r\\nought to have warned you that I am not in the least likely to be a\\r\\ncheerful companion. I have had a most depressing afternoon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have been to your tailor\\'s,\" he suggested, \"and your new gown is a\\r\\nfailure--or is it even worse than that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed dubiously. Then the tea was brought, and for a moment their\\r\\nconversation was interrupted. He thought her very graceful as she bent\\r\\nforward and busied herself attending to his wants. Her affinity to\\r\\nSelina and Louise was undistinguishable. It was true that she was pale,\\r\\nbut it was the pallor of refinement, the student\\'s absence of colour\\r\\nrather than the pallor of ill-health.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Brooks,\" she said, presently, \"you are busy with this election,\\r\\nand you are brought constantly into touch with all classes of people.\\r\\nCan you tell me why it is that it is so hard just now for poor people to\\r\\nget work? Is it true, what they tell me, that many of the factories in\\r\\nMedchester are closed, and many of those that are open are only working\\r\\nhalf and three-quarter time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid that it is quite true, Miss Scott,\" he answered. \"As for\\r\\nthe first part of your question, it is very hard to answer. There seem\\r\\nto be so many causes at work just now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is the work of the politician surely to analyze these causes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It should be,\" he answered. \"Tell me what has brought this into your\\r\\nmind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some of the girls in our class,\" she said, \"are out of work, and those\\r\\nwho have anything to do seem to be working themselves almost to death to\\r\\nkeep their parents or somebody dependent upon them. Two of them I am\\r\\nanxious about. I have been trying to find them this afternoon. I have\\r\\nheard things, Mr. Brooks, which have made me ashamed--sick at\\r\\nheart--ashamed to go home and think how we live, while they die. And\\r\\nthese girls--they have known so much misery. I am afraid of what may\\r\\nhappen to them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These girls are mostly boot and shoe machinists, are they not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. But even Mr. Stuart says that he cannot find them work.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is only this afternoon that we have all been discussing this\\r\\nmatter,\" he said, gravely. \"It is serious enough, God knows. The\\r\\nmanufacturer tells us that he is suffering from American\\r\\ncompetition--here and in the Colonies. He tells us that the workpeople\\r\\nthemselves are largely to blame, that their trades unions restrict them\\r\\nto such an extent that he is hopelessly handicapped from the start. But\\r\\nthere are other causes. There is a terrible wave of depression all\\r\\nthrough the country. The working classes have no money to spend. Every\\r\\nindustry is flagging, and every industry seems threatened with\\r\\ncompetition from abroad. Do you understand the principles of Free Trade\\r\\nat all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not in the least. I wish I did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some day we must have a talk about it. Henslow has made a very daring\\r\\nsuggestion to-day. He has given us all plenty to think about. We are\\r\\nall agreed upon one thing. The crisis is fast approaching, and it must\\r\\nbe faced. These people have the right to live, and they have the right\\r\\nto demand that legislation should interfere on their behalf.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a comfort to hear you talk like this,\" she said. \"To me it seems\\r\\nalmost maddening to see so much suffering, so many people suffering, not\\r\\nonly physically, but being dragged down into a lower moral state by\\r\\nsheer force of circumstances and their surroundings, and all the time we\\r\\neducated people go on our way and live our lives, as though nothing were\\r\\nhappening--as though we had no responsibility whatever for the holocaust\\r\\nof misery at our doors. So few people stop to think. They won\\'t\\r\\nunderstand. It is so easy to put things behind one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" he said, cheerfully, \"you and I, at least, are not amongst\\r\\nthose. And there is a certain duty which we owe to ourselves, too, as\\r\\nwell as to others--to look upon the brighter side of things. Let us\\r\\ntalk about something less depressing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall tell me,\" she suggested, \"who is going to win the election.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Henslow!\" he answered, promptly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Owing, I suppose--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To his agent, of course. You may laugh, Miss Scott, but I can assure\\r\\nyou that my duties are no sinecure. I never knew what work was before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Too much work,\" she said, \"is better than too little. After all, more\\r\\npeople die of the latter than the former.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nature meant me,\" he said, \"for a hazy man. I have all the\\r\\nqualifications for a first-class idler. And circumstances and the\\r\\nmisfortune of my opinions are going to keep me going at express speed\\r\\nall my life. I can see it coming. Sometimes it makes me shudder.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are too young,\" she remarked, \"to shrink from work. I have no\\r\\nsympathy to offer you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I begin to fear, Miss Scott,\" he said, \"that you are not what is called\\r\\nsympathetic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled--and the smile broke into a laugh, as though some transient\\r\\nidea rather than his words had pleased her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You should apply to my cousin Selina for that,\" she said. \"Every one\\r\\ncalls her most delightfully sympathetic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sympathy,\" he remarked, \"is either a heaven-sent joy--or a bore. It\\r\\ndepends upon the individual.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is either enigmatical or rude,\" she answered. \"But, after all,\\r\\nyou don\\'t know Selina.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not?\" he asked. \"I have talked with her as long as with you--and I\\r\\nfeel that I know you quite well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t be responsible for your feelings,\" she said, a little\\r\\nbrusquely, \"but I\\'m quite sure that I don\\'t know you well enough to be\\r\\nsitting here at tea with you even.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I won\\'t admit that,\" he answered, \"but it was very nice of you to come.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The fact of it was,\" she admitted, \"my headache and appetite were\\r\\nstronger than my sense of the conventions. Now that the former are\\r\\ndissipated the latter are beginning to assert themselves. And so--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began to draw on her gloves. Just then a carriage with postilions\\r\\nand ladies with luggage came clattering up the street. She watched it\\r\\nwith darkening face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the sort of man I detest,\" she said, motioning her head towards\\r\\nthe window. \"You know whose carriage it is, don\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I did not know that any one round here drove with positions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is the Marquis of Arranmore. He has a place at Enton, I believe,\\r\\nbut he is only here for a few months in the year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks started and leaned eagerly forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why do you hate him?\" he asked. \"What has he done?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Didn\\'t you hear how he treated the Mayor when he went out for a\\r\\nsubscription to the Unemployed Fund?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! I have heard nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor old Mr. Wensome went out all that way purposely to see him. He\\r\\nwas kept waiting an hour, and then when he explained his errand the\\r\\nMarquis laughed at him. \\'My dear fellow,\\' he said, \\'the poor people of\\r\\nMedchester do not interest me in the least. I do not go to the people\\r\\nwho are better off than I am and ask them to help support me, nor do I\\r\\nsee the least reason why those who are worse off than I am should expect\\r\\nme to support them.\\' Mr. Wensome tried to appeal to his humanity, and\\r\\nthe brute only continued to laugh in a cynical way. He declared that\\r\\npoor people did not interest him. His tenants he was prepared to look\\r\\nafter--outside his own property he didn\\'t care a snap of the fingers\\r\\nwhether people lived or died. Mr. Wensome said it was perfectly awful\\r\\nto hear him talk, and he came away without a penny. Yet his property in\\r\\nthis country alone is worth fifty thousand a year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very surprising,\" Brooks said, thoughtfully. \"The more\\r\\nsurprising because I know of a kind action which he once did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sh! they\\'re coming here!\" she exclaimed. \"That is the Marquis.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe omnibus had pulled up outside. A tall footman threw open the door,\\r\\nand held an umbrella over the two ladies who had descended. The Marquis\\r\\nand two other men followed. They trooped into the little place,\\r\\nbringing with them a strange flavour of another world. The women wore\\r\\nwonderful furs, and one who had ermine around her neck wore a great\\r\\nbunch of Neapolitan violets, whose perfume seemed to fill the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a delightful idea,\" the taller one said, turning towards her\\r\\nhost. \"An eight-mile drive before tea sounded appalling. Where shall\\r\\nwe sit, and may we have muffins?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is nothing about your youth, Lady Sybil, which I envy more than\\r\\nyour digestion,\" he answered, motioning them towards a table. \"To be\\r\\nable to eat muffins with plenty of butter would be unalloyed bliss.\\r\\nNevertheless, you shall have them. No one has ever called me selfish.\\r\\nLet us have tea, and toast, and bread-and-butter and cakes, and a great\\r\\nmany muffins, please, young lady,\" he ordered. \"And will you send out\\r\\nsome tea to my servants, please? It will save them from trying to\\r\\nobtain drinks from the hotel next door, and ensure us a safe drive\\r\\nhome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And don\\'t forget to send out for that pack of cards, Arranmore,\" the\\r\\nelder lady said. \"We are going to play bridge driving home with that\\r\\nwonderful little electric lamp of yours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not forget,\" he promised. \"We are to be partners, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was on the point of sitting down when he saw Brooks at the next\\r\\ntable. He held out his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you do, Mr. Brooks?\" he said. \"I am glad to see that you are\\r\\ngoing to get your man in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" Brooks answered, rising and waiting for his companion, who\\r\\nwas buttoning her gloves. \"I was afraid that your sympathies would be\\r\\non the other side.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me, no,\" the Marquis answered. \"My enemies would tell you that I\\r\\nhave neither sympathy nor politics, but I assure you that at heart I am\\r\\na most devout Radical. I have a vote, too, and you may count upon me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very glad to hear it,\" Brooks answered. \"Shall I put you down on\\r\\nthe list \\'to be fetched\\'?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marquis laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll come without,\" he declared. \"I promise. Just remind me of the\\r\\nday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced towards Mary Scott, and for a moment seemed about to include\\r\\nher in some forthcoming remark. But whatever it might have been--it was\\r\\nnever made. She kept her eyes averted, and though her self-possession\\r\\nwas absolutely unruffled she hastened her departure. \"I am not hurrying\\r\\nyou, Mr. Brooks?\" she asked. \"Not in the least,\" he assured her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe raised his hat to the Marquis and his party, and the former nodded\\r\\ngood-humouredly. There was silence until the two were in the street.\\r\\nThen one of the men who had been looking after them dropped his\\r\\neye-glass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you what,\" he said to his vis-a-vis. \"There\\'s some chance for\\r\\nus in Medchester after all. I don\\'t believe Arranmore is popular\\r\\namongst the ladies of his own neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marquis laughed softly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has a nice face,\" he remarked, \"and I should imagine excellent\\r\\nperceptions. Curiously enough, too, she reminded me of some one who has\\r\\nevery reason to hate me. But to the best of my belief I never saw her\\r\\nbefore in my life. Lady Caroom, that weird-looking object in front of\\r\\nyou is a teapot--and those are teacups. May I suggest a use for them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MAN WHO WENT TO HELL\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hon. Sydney Chester Molyneux stood with his cue in one hand, and an\\r\\nopen telegram in the other, in the billiard-room at Enton. He was\\r\\nvisibly annoyed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Beastly hard luck,\" he declared. \"Parliament is a shocking grind\\r\\nanyway. It isn\\'t that one ever does anything, you know, but one wastes\\r\\nsuch a lot of time when one might have been doing something worth\\r\\nwhile.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do repeat that, Sydney,\" Lady Caroom begged, laying down her novel for\\r\\na moment. \"It really sounds as though it ought to mean something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I couldn\\'t!\" he admitted. \"I wish to cultivate a reputation for\\r\\noriginality, and my first object is to forget everything I have said\\r\\ndirectly I have said it, in case I should repeat myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A short memory,\" Arranmore remarked, \"is a politician\\'s most valuable\\r\\npossession, isn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No memory at all is better,\" Molyneux answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And your telegram?\" Lady Caroom asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is from my indefatigable uncle,\" Molyneux groaned. \"He insists upon it\\r\\nthat I interest myself in the election here, which means that I must go\\r\\nin to-morrow and call upon Rochester.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe younger girl looked up from her chair, and laughed softly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will have to speak for him,\" she said. \"How interesting! We will\\r\\nall come in and hear you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMolyneux missed an easy cannon, and laid down his cue with an aggrieved\\r\\nair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is all very well for you,\" he remarked, dismally, \"but it is a\\r\\nhorrible grind for me. I have just succeeded in forgetting all that we\\r\\ndid last session, and our programme for next. Now I\\'ve got to wade\\r\\nthrough it all. I wonder why on earth Providence selected for me an\\r\\nuncle who thinks it worth while to be a Cabinet Minister?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil Caroom shrugged her shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder why on earth,\" she remarked, \"any constituency thinks it worth\\r\\nwhile to be represented by such a politician as you. How did you get\\r\\nin, Sydney?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" he answered. \"I was on the right side, and I talked the\\r\\nusual rot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For myself,\" she said, \"I like a politician who is in earnest. They\\r\\nare more amusing, and more impressive in every way. Who was the young\\r\\nman you spoke to in that little place where we had tea?\" she asked her\\r\\nhost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His name is Kingston Brooks,\" Arranmore answered. \"He is the agent for\\r\\nHenslow, the Radical candidate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I liked him,\" she said. \"If I had a vote I would let him convert\\r\\nme to Radicalism. I am sure that he could do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He shall try--if you like,\" Arranmore remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am going to ask him to shoot one day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am delighted to hear it,\" the girl answered. \"I think he would be a\\r\\nwholesome change. You are all too flippant here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door opened. Mr. Hennibul, K.C., inserted his head and shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been to look at Arranmore\\'s golf-links,\" he remarked. \"They are\\r\\nquite decent. Will some one come and play a round?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will come,\" Sybil declared, putting down her book.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I,\" Molyneux joined in. \"Hennibul can play our best ball.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom and her host were left alone. He came over to her side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can I do to entertain your ladyship?\" he asked, lightly. \"Will\\r\\nyou play billiards, walk or drive? There is an hour before lunch which\\r\\nmust be charmed away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not energetic,\" she declared. \"I ought to walk for the sake of my\\r\\nfigure. I\\'m getting shockingly stout. Marie made me promise to walk a\\r\\nmile to-day. But I\\'m feeling deliciously lazy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"/Embonpoint/ is the fashion,\" he remarked, \"and you are inches short of\\r\\neven that yet. Come and sit in the study while I write some letters.\"\\r\\nShe held out her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pull me up, then! I am much too comfortable to move unaided.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sprang to her feet lightly enough, and for a moment he kept her\\r\\nhands, which rested willingly enough in his. They looked at one another\\r\\nin silence. Then she laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Arranmore,\" she protested, \"I am not made up half carefully\\r\\nenough to stand such a critical survey by daylight. Your north windows\\r\\nare too terrible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not to you, dear lady,\" he answered, smiling. \"I was wondering whether\\r\\nit was possible that you could be forty-one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You brute,\" she exclaimed, with uplifted eyebrows. \"How dare you?\\r\\nForty if you like--for as long as you like. Forty is the fashionable\\r\\nage, but one year over that is fatal. Don\\'t you know that now-a-days a\\r\\nwoman goes straight from forty to sixty? It is such a delicious long\\r\\nrest. And besides, it gives a woman an object in life which she has\\r\\nprobably been groping about for all her days. One is never bored after\\r\\nforty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the object?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To keep young, of course. There\\'s scope for any amount of ingenuity.\\r\\nSince that dear man in Paris has hit upon the real secret of enamelling,\\r\\nwe are thinking of extending the limit to sixty-five. Lily Cestigan is\\r\\nseventy-one, you know, and she told me only last week that Mat\\r\\nHarlowe--you know Harlowe, he\\'s rather a nice boy, in the Guards had\\r\\nasked her to run away with him. She\\'s known him three months, and he\\'s\\r\\nseen her at least three times by daylight. She\\'s delighted about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is she going?\" Arranmore asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'m not sure that she\\'d care to risk that,\" Lady Caroom answered,\\r\\nthoughtfully. \"She told him she\\'d think about it, and, meanwhile, he\\'s\\r\\njust as devoted as ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey crossed the great stone hall together--the hall which, with its\\r\\nwonderful pillars and carved dome, made Enton the show-house of the\\r\\ncounty. Arranmore\\'s study was a small octagonal room leading out from\\r\\nthe library. A fire of cedar logs was burning in an open grate, and he\\r\\nwheeled up an easy-chair for her close to his writing-table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder,\" she remarked, thoughtfully, \"what you think of Syd\\r\\nMolyneux?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is there anything--to be thought about him?\" he answered, lighting a\\r\\ncigarette.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s rather that way, isn\\'t he?\" she assented. \"I mean for Sybil, you\\r\\nknow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should let Sybil decide,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She probably will,\" Lady Caroom said. \"Still, she\\'s horribly bored at\\r\\nhaving to be dragged about to places, you know, and that sort of thing,\\r\\njust because she isn\\'t married, and she likes Syd all right. He\\'s no\\r\\nfool!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose not,\" Arranmore answered. \"He\\'s of a type, you know, which\\r\\nhas sprung up during my--absence from civilization. You want to grow up\\r\\nwith it to appreciate it properly. I don\\'t think he\\'s good enough for\\r\\nSybil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sybil\\'s a dear girl,\" she said, \"although she\\'s a terrible nuisance to\\r\\nme. I shouldn\\'t be at all surprised either if she developed views. I\\r\\nwish you were a marrying man, Arranmore. I used to think of you myself\\r\\nonce, but you would be too old for me now. You\\'re exactly the right age\\r\\nfor Sybil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore smiled. He had quite forgotten his letters. Lady Caroom\\r\\nalways amused him so well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is very like what you were at her age,\" he remarked. \"What a pity\\r\\nit was that I was such a poverty-stricken beggar in those days. I am\\r\\nsure that I should have married you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I am beginning to like you,\" she declared, settling down more\\r\\ncomfortably in her chair. \"If you can keep up like that we shall be\\r\\ngetting positively sentimental presently, and if there\\'s anything I\\r\\nadore in this world--especially before luncheon--it is sentiment. Do\\r\\nyou remember we used to waltz together, Arranmore?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You gave me a glove one night,\" he said. \"I have it still.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you pressed my hand--and--it was in the Setons\\' conservatory--how\\r\\nbold you were.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the next day,\" he declared, in an aggrieved tone, \"I heard that you\\r\\nwere engaged to Caroom. You treated me shamefully.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These reminiscences,\" she declared, \"are really sweet, but you are most\\r\\nungrateful. I was really almost too kind to you. They were all\\r\\nfearfully anxious to get me married, because Dumesnil always used to say\\r\\nthat my complexion would give out in a year or two, and I wasted no end\\r\\nof time upon you, who were perfectly hopeless as a husband. After all,\\r\\nthough, I believe it paid. It used to annoy Caroom so much, and I\\r\\nbelieve he proposed to me long before he meant to so as to get rid of\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I,\" Arranmore remarked, \"was the victim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat up with eyes suddenly bright.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" she declared, \"I have an idea. It is the most charming\\r\\nand flattering thing, and it never occurred to me before. After all, it\\r\\nwas not eccentricity which caused you to throw up your work at the\\r\\nBar--and disappear. It was your hopeless devotion to me. Don\\'t\\r\\ndisappoint me now by denying it. Please don\\'t! It was the announcement\\r\\nof my engagement, wasn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And it has taken you all these years to find it out?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was shockingly obtuse,\" she murmured. \"The thing came to me just now\\r\\nas a revelation. Poor, dear man, how you must have suffered. This puts\\r\\nus on a different footing altogether, doesn\\'t it?\" \"Altogether,\" he\\r\\nadmitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And,\" she continued, eyeing him now with a sudden nervousness,\\r\\n\"emboldens me to ask you a question which I have been dying to ask you\\r\\nfor the last few years. I wonder whether you will answer it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder!\" he repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nA change in him, too, was noticeable. That wonderful impassivity of\\r\\nfeature which never even in his lighter moments passed altogether away,\\r\\nseemed to deepen every line in his hard, clear-cut face. His mouth was\\r\\nclose drawn, his eyes were suddenly colder and expressionless. There\\r\\nwas about him at such times as--these an almost repellent hardness. His\\r\\nemotions, and the man himself, seemed frozen. Lady Caroom had seen him\\r\\nlook like it once before, and she sighed. Nevertheless, she persevered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For nearly twenty years,\" she said, \"you disappeared. You were\\r\\nreported at different times to be in every quarter of the earth, from\\r\\nZambesia to Pekin. But no one knew, and, of course, in a season or two\\r\\nyou were forgotten. I always wondered, I am wondering now, where were\\r\\nyou? What did you do with yourself?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went down into Hell,\" he answered. \"Can\\'t you see the marks of it in\\r\\nmy face? For many years I lived in Hell--for many years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You puzzle me,\" she said, in a low tone. \"You had no taste for\\r\\ndissipation. You look as though life had scorched you up at some time\\r\\nor other. But how? where? You were found in Canada, I know, when your\\r\\nbrother died. But you had only been there for a few years. Before\\r\\nthen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay! Before then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a short silence. Then Arranmore, who had been gazing steadily\\r\\ninto the fire, looked up. She fancied that his eyes were softer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear friend,\" he said, \"of those days I have nothing to tell--even you.\\r\\nBut there are more awful things even than moral degeneration. You do me\\r\\njustice when you impute that I never ate from the trough. But what I\\r\\ndid, and where I lived, I do not think that I shall ever willingly tell\\r\\nany one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA piece of burning wood fell upon the hearthstone. He stooped and\\r\\npicked it up, placed it carefully in its place, and busied himself for a\\r\\nmoment or two with the little brass poker. Then he straightened\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Catherine,\" he said, \"I think if I were you that I would not marry\\r\\nSybil to Molyneux. It struck me to-day that his eyeglass-chain was of\\r\\nlast year\\'s pattern, and I am not sure that he is sound on the subject\\r\\nof collars. You know how important these things are to a young man who\\r\\nhas to make his own way in the world. Perhaps, I am not sure, but I\\r\\nthink it is very likely I might be able to find a husband for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You dear man,\" Lady Caroom murmured. \"I should rely upon your taste\\r\\nand judgment so thoroughly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a discreet knock at the door. A servant entered with a card.\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore took it up, and retained it in his fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell Mr. Brooks,\" he said, \"that I will be with him in a moment. If\\r\\nhe has ridden over, ask him to take some refreshment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a visitor,\" Lady Caroom said, rising. \"If you will excuse me\\r\\nI will go and lie down until luncheon-time, and let my maid touch me up.\\r\\nThese sentimental conversations are so harrowing. I feel a perfect\\r\\nwreck.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe glided from the room, graceful, brisk and charming, the most\\r\\nwonderful woman in England, as the Society papers were never tired of\\r\\ncalling her. Arranmore glanced once more at the card between his\\r\\nfingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Kingston Brooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood for a few seconds, motionless. Then he rang the bell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Show Mr. Brooks in here,\" he directed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\nA THOUSAND POUNDS\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks had ridden a bicycle from Medchester, and his trousers and boots\\r\\nwere splashed with mud. His presence at Enton was due to an impulse,\\r\\nthe inspiration of which he had already begun seriously to doubt.\\r\\nArranmore\\'s kindly reception of him was more than ordinarily welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very glad to see you, Mr. Brooks,\" he said, holding out his hand.\\r\\n\"How comes it that you are able to take even so short a holiday as this?\\r\\nI pictured you surrounded by canvassers and bill-posters and\\r\\njournalists, all clamouring for your ear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks laughed, completely at his ease now, thanks to the unspoken\\r\\ncordiality of the other man. He took the easy-chair which the servant\\r\\nhad noiselessly wheeled up to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid that you exaggerate my importance,--Lord Arranmore,\" he\\r\\nsaid. \"I was very busy early this morning, and I shall be again after\\r\\nfour. But I am allowed a little respite now and then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You spend it very sensibly out of doors,\" Arranmore remarked. \"How did\\r\\nyou get here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cycled,\" Brooks answered. \"It was very pleasant, but muddy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What will you have?\" Lord Arranmore asked. \"Some wine and biscuits, or\\r\\nsomething of that sort?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis hand was upon the bell, but Brooks stopped him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing at all, thank you, just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Luncheon will be served in half-an-hour,\" the Marquis said. \"You will\\r\\nprefer to wait until then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am much obliged to you,\" Brooks answered, \"but I must be getting back\\r\\nto Medchester as soon as possible. Besides,\" he added, with a smile, \"I\\r\\nam afraid when I have spoken of the object of my visit you may feel\\r\\ninclined to kick me out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not,\" Arranmore replied, lightly. \"I was hoping that your visit\\r\\nhad no object at all, and that you had been good enough just to look me\\r\\nup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should not have intruded without a purpose,\" Brooks said, quietly,\\r\\n\"but you will be almost justified in treating my visit as an\\r\\nimpertinence when I have disclosed my errand. Lord Arranmore, I am the\\r\\nsecretary for the fund which is being raised in Medchester for the\\r\\nrelief of the Unemployed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes,\" he said. \"I had a visit a few days ago from a worthy\\r\\nMedchester gentleman connected with it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is concerning that visit, Lord Arranmore, that I have come to see\\r\\nyou,\" Brooks continued, quietly. \"I only heard of it yesterday\\r\\nafternoon, but this morning it seems to me that every one whom I have\\r\\nmet has alluded to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marquis was lounging against the broad mantelpiece. Some part of\\r\\nthe cordiality of his manner had vanished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Arranmore, I wondered whether it was not possible that some\\r\\nmistake had been made,\" Brooks said. \"I wondered whether Mr. Wensome\\r\\nhad altogether understood you properly--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did my best to be explicit,\" the Marquis murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or whether you had misunderstood him,\" Brooks continued, doggedly.\\r\\n\"This fund has become absolutely necessary unless we wish to see the\\r\\npeople starve in the streets. There are between six and seven thousand\\r\\noperatives and artisans in Medchester to-day who are without work\\r\\nthrough no fault of their own. It is our duty as citizens to do our\\r\\nbest for them. Nearly every one in Medchester has contributed according\\r\\nto their means. You are a large property-owner in the town. Cannot you\\r\\nconsider this appeal as an unenforced rate? It comes to that in the\\r\\nlong run.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marquis shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think,\" he said, \"that on the subject of charity Englishmen generally\\r\\nwholly misapprehend the situation. You say that between six and seven\\r\\nthousand men are out of work in Medchester. Very well, I affirm that\\r\\nthere must be a cause for that. If you are a philanthropist it is your\\r\\nduty to at once investigate the economic and political reasons for such\\r\\na state of things, and alter them. By going about and collecting money\\r\\nfor these people you commit what is little short of a crime. You must\\r\\nknow the demoralizing effect of charity. No man who has ever received a\\r\\ndole is ever again an independent person. Besides that, you are\\r\\ndiverting the public mind from the real point of issue, which is not\\r\\nthat so many thousand people are hungry, but that a flaw exists in the\\r\\nadministration of the laws of the country so grave that a certain number\\r\\nof thousands of people who have a God-sent right to productive labour\\r\\nhaven\\'t got it. Do you follow me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly,\" Brooks answered. \"You did not talk like this to Mr.\\r\\nWensome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I admit it. He was an ignorant man in whom I felt no interest\\r\\nwhatever, and I did not take the trouble. Besides, I will frankly admit\\r\\nthat I am in no sense of the word a sentimentalist. The distresses of\\r\\nother people do not interest me particularly. I have been poor myself,\\r\\nand I never asked for, nor was offered, any sort of help. Consequently\\r\\nI feel very little responsibility concerning these unfortunate people,\\r\\nwhose cause you have espoused.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I revert to your first argument?\" Brooks said. \"If you saw a man\\r\\ndrowning then, instead of trying to save him you would subscribe towards\\r\\na fund to teach people to swim?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is ingenious,\" Lord Arranmore replied, smiling grimly, \"but it\\r\\ndoesn\\'t interest me. If I saw a man drowning I shouldn\\'t think of\\r\\ninterfering unless the loss of that man brought inconvenience or loss to\\r\\nmyself. If it did I should endeavour to save him--not unless. As for\\r\\nthe fund you speak of, I should not think of subscribing to it. It\\r\\nwould not interest me to know that other people were provided with a\\r\\nsafeguard against drowning. I should probably spend the money in\\r\\nperfecting myself in the art of swimming. Don\\'t you see that no man who\\r\\nhas ever received help from another is exactly in the same position\\r\\nagain? As an individual he is a weaker creature. That is where I\\r\\ndisagree with nearly every existing form of charity. They are wrong in\\r\\nprinciple. They are a debauchment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your views, Lord Arranmore,\" Brooks said, \"are excellent for a model\\r\\nworld. For practical purposes I think they are a little pedantic. You\\r\\nare quite right in your idea that charity is a great danger. I can\\r\\nassure you that we are trying to realize that in Medchester. We ask for\\r\\nmoney, and we dispense it unwillingly, but as a necessary evil. And we\\r\\nare trying to earnestly see where our social system is at fault, and to\\r\\nreadjust it. But meanwhile, men and women and children even are\\r\\nstarving. We must help them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is where you are wholly wrong, and where you retard all progress,\"\\r\\nArranmore remarked. \"Can\\'t you see that you are continually plugging up\\r\\ndangerous leaks with putty instead of lead? You muffle the cry which\\r\\nbut for you must ring through the land, and make itself heard to every\\r\\none. Let the people starve who are without means. Legislation would\\r\\nstir itself fast enough then. It is the only way. Charity to\\r\\nindividuals is poison to the multitude. You create the criminal classes\\r\\nwith your charities, you blindfold statesmen and mislead political\\r\\neconomists. I tell you that the more you give away the more distress\\r\\nyou create.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks rose from his seat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Charity is older than nations or history, Lord Arranmore,\" he said,\\r\\n\"and I am foolish enough to think that the world is a better place for\\r\\nit. Your reasoning is very excellent, but life has not yet become an\\r\\nexact science. The weaknesses of men and women have to be considered.\\r\\nYou have probably never seen a starving person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore laughed, and Brooks looked across the room at him in\\r\\namazement. The Marquis was always pale, but his pallor just then was as\\r\\nunnatural as the laugh itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear young man,\" he said, \"if I could show you what I have seen your\\r\\nhair would turn grey, and your wits go wandering. Do you think that I\\r\\nknow nothing of life save its crust? I tell you that I have been down\\r\\nin the depths, aye, single-handed, there in the devil\\'s own cauldron,\\r\\nwhere creatures in the shape of men and women, the very sight of whom\\r\\nwould turn you sick with horror, creep like spawn through life,\\r\\nbrainless and soulless, foul things who would murder one another for the\\r\\nsake of a crust, or--Bah! What horrible memories.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe broke off abruptly. When he spoke again his tone was as usual.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" he said, \"I mustn\\'t let you have this journey for nothing.\\r\\nAfter all, the only luxury in having principles is in the departing from\\r\\nthem. I will give you a cheque, Mr. Brooks, only I beg you to think\\r\\nover what I have said. Abandon this doling principle as soon as it is\\r\\npossible. Give your serious attention to the social questions and\\r\\nimperfect laws which are at the back of all this distress.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks felt as though he had been awakened from a nightmare. He never\\r\\nforgot that single moment of revelation on the part of the man who sat\\r\\nnow smiling and debonair before his writing-table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very kind indeed, Lord Arranmore,\" he said. \"I can assure you\\r\\nthat the money will be most carefully used, and amongst my party, at any\\r\\nrate, we do really appreciate the necessity for going to the root of the\\r\\nmatter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore\\'s pen went scratching across the paper. He tore out a cheque,\\r\\nand placing it in an envelope, handed it to Brooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I noticed,\" he remarked, thoughtfully, \"that a good many people coming\\r\\nout of the factories hissed my carriage in Medchester last time I was\\r\\nthere. I hope they will not consider my cheque as a sign of weakness.\\r\\nBut after all,\" he added, with a smile, \"what does it matter? Let us go\\r\\nin to luncheon, Brooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks glanced down at his mud-splashed clothes and boots.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must really ask you to excuse me,\" he began, but Arranmore only rang\\r\\nthe bell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My valet will smarten you up,\" he said. \"Here, Fritz, take Mr. Brooks\\r\\ninto my room and look after him, will you. I shall be in the hall when\\r\\nyou come down.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he passed from the dressing-room a few minutes later, Brooks paused\\r\\nfor a moment to look up at the wonderful ceiling above the hall. Below,\\r\\nLord Arranmore was idly knocking about the billiard balls, and all\\r\\naround him was the murmur of pleasant conversation. Brooks drew the\\r\\nenvelope from his pocket and glanced at the cheque. He gave a little\\r\\ngasp of astonishment. It was for a thousand pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\nKINGSTON BROOKS MAKES INQUIRIES\\r\\n\\r\\nAt luncheon Brooks found himself between Sybil Caroom and Mr. Hennibul.\\r\\nShe began to talk to him at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to know all about your candidate, Mr. Brooks,\" she declared.\\r\\n\"You can\\'t imagine how pleased I am to have you here. I have had the\\r\\nfeeling ever since I came of being shut up in a hostile camp. I am a\\r\\nRadical, you know, and these good people, even my mother, are rabid\\r\\nConservatives.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks smiled as he unfolded his serviette.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Henslow isn\\'t exactly an ornamental candidate,\" he said, \"but he\\r\\nis particularly sound and a man with any amount of common-sense. You\\r\\nshould come and hear him speak.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'d love to,\" she answered, \"but no one would bring me from here. They\\r\\nare all hopeless. Mr. Molyneux there is going to support Mr.\\r\\nRochester. If I wasn\\'t sure that he\\'d do more harm than good, I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t let him go. But I don\\'t suppose they\\'ll let you speak,\\r\\nSydney,\" she added. \"They won\\'t if they\\'ve ever heard you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMolyneux smiled an imperturbable smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Personally,\" he said, \"I should prefer to lend my moral support only,\\r\\nbut my fame as an orator is too well known. There is not the least\\r\\nchance that they will let me off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil looked at Brooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you ever hear such conceit?\" she remarked, in a pitying tone. \"And\\r\\nI don\\'t believe he\\'s ever opened his mouth in the House, except to shout\\r\\n\\'Hear, hear\\'! Besides, he\\'s as nervous as a kitten. Tell me, are you\\r\\ngoing to return Mr. Henslow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think so,\" Brooks answered. \"It is certain to be a very close\\r\\ncontest, but I believe we shall get a small majority. The Jingo element\\r\\nare our greatest trouble. They are all the time trying to make people\\r\\nbelieve that Conservatives have the monopoly of the Imperial sentiment.\\r\\nAs a matter of fact, I think that Henslow is almost rabid on the war\\r\\nquestion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Still, your platform--to use an Americanism,\" Mr. Hennibul interposed,\\r\\n\"must be founded upon domestic questions. Medchester is a manufacturing\\r\\ntown, and I am given to understand is suffering severely. Has your man\\r\\nany original views on the present depression in trade?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks glanced towards the speaker with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have been reading the Medchester Post!\" he remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe barrister nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. It hinted at some rather surprising revelation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must read Henslow\\'s speech at the mass meeting to-morrow night,\"\\r\\nBrooks said. \"At present I mustn\\'t discuss these matters too much,\\r\\nespecially before a political opponent,\" he remarked, smiling at Mr.\\r\\nMolyneux. \"You might induce Mr. Rochester to play our trump card.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If your trump card is what I suspect it to be,\" Mr. Hennibul said, \"I\\r\\ndon\\'t think you need fear that. Rochester would be ready enough to try\\r\\nit, but some of his supporters wouldn\\'t listen to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation drifted away from politics. Brooks found himself\\r\\nenjoying his luncheon amazingly. Sybil Caroom devoted herself to him,\\r\\nand he found himself somehow drawn with marvellous facility into the\\r\\nlittle circle of intimate friends. Afterwards they all strolled into\\r\\nthe hall together for coffee, and Arranmore laid his hand upon his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry that you will not have time to look round the place,\" he\\r\\nsaid. \"You must come over again before long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very kind,\" Brooks said, dropping his voice a little. \"There\\r\\nare one or two more things which I should like to ask you about Canada.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall always be at your service,\" Lord Arranmore answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I cannot go,\" Brooks continued, \"without thanking you--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will take that for granted,\" Arranmore interrupted. \"You know the\\r\\nspirit in which I gave it. It is not, I fear, one of sympathy, but it\\r\\nmay at any rate save me from having my carriage windows broken one dark\\r\\nnight. By the bye, I have ordered a brougham for you in half-an-hour.\\r\\nAs you see, it is raining. Your bicycle shall be sent in to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very kind of you indeed,\" Brooks declared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Molyneux has to go in, so you may just as well drive together,\"\\r\\nArranmore remarked. \"By the bye, do you shoot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little,\" Brooks admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must have a day with us. My head keeper is coming up this\\r\\nafternoon, and I will try and arrange something. The election is next\\r\\nweek, of course. We must plan a day after then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid that my performance would scarcely be up to your standard,\"\\r\\nBrooks said, \"although it is very kind of you to ask me. I might come\\r\\nand look on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hennibul is all right,\" he said, \"but Molyneux is a shocking duffer.\\r\\nWe\\'ll give you an easy place. We have some early callers, I see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe butler was moving towards them, followed by two men in\\r\\nhunting-clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir George Marson and Mr. Lacroix, your lordship,\" he announced.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a second Arranmore stood motionless. His eyes seemed to pass\\r\\nthrough the man in pink, who was approaching with outstretched hand, and\\r\\nto be fastened upon the face of his companion. It chanced that Brooks,\\r\\nwho had stepped a little on one side, was watching his host, and for the\\r\\nsecond time in one day he saw things which amazed him. His expression\\r\\nseemed frozen on to his face--something underneath seemed struggling for\\r\\nexpression. In a second it had all passed away. Brooks could almost\\r\\nhave persuaded himself that it was fancy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come for something to eat, Arranmore,\" Sir George declared, hungrily.\\r\\n\"My second man\\'s gone off with the sandwich-case--hunting on his own, I\\r\\nbelieve. I\\'ll sack him to-morrow. Here\\'s my friend Lacroix, who says\\r\\nyou saved him from starvation once before out in the wilds somewhere.\\r\\nAwfully sorry to take you by storm like this, but we\\'re twelve miles\\r\\nfrom home, and it\\'s a God-forsaken country for inns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Luncheon for two at once, Groves,\" Lord Arranmore answered. \"Delighted\\r\\nto meet you again, Mr. Lacroix. Last time we were both of us in very\\r\\ndifferent trim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom came gliding up to them, and shook hands with Sir George.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This sounds so interesting,\" she murmured. \"Did you say that you met\\r\\nLord Arranmore in his exploring days?\" she asked, turning to Mr.\\r\\nLacroix.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I found Lord Arranmore in a log hut which he had built himself on the\\r\\nshores of Lake Ono,\" Lacroix said, smiling. \"And when I tell you that I\\r\\nhad lost all my stores, and that his was the only dwelling-place for\\r\\nfifty miles around, you can imagine that his hospitality was more\\r\\nwelcome to me then even than to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks, who was standing near, could not repress a start. He fancied\\r\\nthat Lord Arranmore glanced in his direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom shuddered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The only dwelling-house for fifty miles,\" she repeated. \"What hideous\\r\\nmisanthropy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was no doubt about it,\" Lacroix declared, smiling. \"My Indian\\r\\nguide, who knew every inch of the country, told me so many times. I can\\r\\nassure you that Lord Arranmore, whom I am very pleased to meet again,\\r\\nwas a very different person in those days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe butler glided up from the background.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Luncheon is served in the small dining-room, Sir George,\" he announced.\\r\\n\\r\\n              *     *     *     *     *\\r\\n\\r\\nMolyneux and Brooks drove in together to Medchester, and the former was\\r\\ndisposed--for him to be talkative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Queer thing about Lacroix turning up,\" he remarked. \"I fancy our host\\r\\nlooked a bit staggered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was enough to surprise him,\" Brooks answered. \"From Lake Ono to\\r\\nMedchester is a long way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMolyneux nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Jove, it is,\" he affirmed. \"Queer stick our host. Close as wax.\\r\\nI\\'ve known him ever since he dropped in for the title and estates, and\\r\\nI\\'ve never yet heard him open his mouth on the subject of his travels.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was he away from England for very long?\" Brooks asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No one knows where he was,\" Molyneux replied. \"Twenty years ago he was\\r\\nreading for the Bar in London, and he suddenly disappeared. Well, I\\r\\nhave never met a soul except Lacroix to-day who has seen anything of him\\r\\nin the interval between his disappearance and his coming to claim the\\r\\nestates. That means that for pretty well half a lifetime he passed\\r\\ncompletely out of the world. Poor beggar! I fancy that he was hard up,\\r\\nfor one thing.\" To Brooks the subject was fascinating, but he had an\\r\\nidea that it was scarcely the best of form to be discussing their late\\r\\nhost with a man who was comparatively a stranger to him. So he remained\\r\\nsilent, and Molyneux, with a yawn, abandoned the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where does Rochester hang out, do you know?\" he asked Brooks. \"I don\\'t\\r\\nsuppose for a moment I shall be able to find him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His headquarters are at the Bell Hotel,\" Brooks replied. \"You will\\r\\neasily be able to come across him, for he has a series of ward meetings\\r\\nto-night. I am sorry that we are to be opponents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shan\\'t quarrel about that,\" Molyneux answered. \"Here we are, at\\r\\nMedchester, then. Better let him put you down, and then he can go on\\r\\nwith me. You\\'re coming out to shoot at Enton, aren\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Arranmore was good enough to ask me,\" Brooks answered, dubiously,\\r\\n\"but I scarcely know whether I ought to accept. I am such a wretched\\r\\nshot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMolyneux laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I couldn\\'t hit a haystack,\" he said, \"so you needn\\'t mind that.\\r\\nBesides, Arranmore isn\\'t keen about his bag, like some chaps. Are these\\r\\nyour offices? See you again, then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks found a dozen matters waiting for his attention. But before he\\r\\nsettled down to work he wrote two letters. One was to the man who was\\r\\ndoing his work as Secretary to the Unemployed Fund during the election,\\r\\nand with a brief mention of a large subscription, instructed him to open\\r\\nseveral relief stations which they had been obliged to chose a few days\\r\\nago. And the other letter was to Victor Lacroix, whom he addressed at\\r\\nWestbury Park, Sir George Marson\\'s seat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should be exceedingly obliged if you would accord me a few minutes\\'\\r\\ninterview on a purely personal matter. I will wait upon you anywhere,\\r\\naccording to your convenience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yours faithfully,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"KINGSTON BROOKS.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\nHENSLOW SPEAKS OUT\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bomb was thrown. Some ten thousand people crowded together in the\\r\\nmarket-place at Medchester, under what seemed to be one huge canopy of\\r\\ndripping umbrellas, heard for the first time for many years a bold and\\r\\nvigorous attack upon the principles which had come to be considered a\\r\\npart of the commercial ritual of the country. Henslow made the best of\\r\\na great opportunity. He spoke temperately, but without hesitation, and\\r\\nconcluded with a biting and powerful onslaught upon that class of\\r\\nEnglishmen who wilfully closed their eyes to the prevailing industrial\\r\\ndepression, and endeavoured to lure themselves and others into a sense\\r\\nof false security as to the well-being of the country by means of\\r\\nillusive statistics. In his appreciation of dramatic effect, and the\\r\\nsmall means by which an audience can be touched, Henslow was a past\\r\\nmaster. Early in his speech he had waved aside the umbrella which a\\r\\nsupporter was holding over him, and regardless of the rain, he stood out\\r\\nin the full glare of the reflected gaslight, a ponderous, powerful\\r\\nfigure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No one can accuse me,\" he cried, \"of being a pessimist. Throughout my\\r\\nlife I have striven personally, and politically, to look upon the\\r\\nbrightest side of things. But I count it a crime to shut one\\'s eyes to\\r\\nthe cloud in the sky, even though it be no larger than a man\\'s hand.\\r\\nYears ago that cloud was there for those who would to see. To-day it\\r\\nlooms over us, a black and threatening peril, and those who,\\r\\nostrich-like, still hide their heads in the sand, are the men upon whose\\r\\nconsciences must rest in the future the responsibility for those evil\\r\\nthings which are even now upon us. Theories are evil things, but when\\r\\ntheory and fact are at variance, give me fact. Theoretically Free Trade\\r\\nshould--I admit it--make us the most prosperous nation in the world. As\\r\\na matter of fact, never since this country commenced to make history has\\r\\nour commercial supremacy been in so rotten and insecure a position.\\r\\nThere isn\\'t a flourishing industry in the country, save those which\\r\\nprovide the munitions of war, and their prosperity is a spasmodic, and I\\r\\nmight almost add, an undesirable thing. Now, I am dealing with facts\\r\\nto-night, not theories, and I am going to quote certain unassailable\\r\\ntruths, and I am going to give you the immediate causes for them. The\\r\\nfurniture and joinery trade of England is bad. There are thousands of\\r\\ngood hands out of employment. They are out of work because the\\r\\nmanufacturer has few or no orders. I want the immediate cause for that,\\r\\nand I go to the manufacturer. I ask him why he has no orders. He tells\\r\\nme, because every steamer from America is bringing huge consignments of\\r\\nready-made office and general furniture, at such prices or such quality\\r\\nthat the English shopkeepers prefer to stock them. Consequently trade\\r\\nis bad with him, and he cannot find employment for his men. I find\\r\\nhere in Medchester the boot and shoe trade in which you are concerned\\r\\nbad. There are thousands of you who are willing to work who are out of\\r\\nemployment. I go to the manufacturer, and I say to him, \\'Why don\\'t you\\r\\nfind employment for your hands?\\' \\'For two reasons,\\' he answers. \\'First,\\r\\nbecause I have lost my Colonial and some of my home trade through\\r\\nAmerican competition, and secondly, because of the universally depressed\\r\\ncondition of every kindred trade throughout the country, which keeps\\r\\npeople poor and prevents their having money to spend.\\' Just now I am not\\r\\nconsidering the question of why the American can send salable boots and\\r\\nshoes into this country, although the reasons are fairly obvious. They\\r\\nhave nothing to do with my point, however. We are dealing to-night with\\r\\nimmediate causes!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now as to that depression throughout the country which keeps people\\r\\npoor, as the boot manufacturer puts it, and prevents their having money\\r\\nto spend. I am going to take several trades one by one, and ascertain\\r\\nthe immediate cause of their depression--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had hold of his audience, and he made good use of his advantage. He\\r\\nquoted statistics, showing the decrease of exports and relative increase\\r\\nof imports. How could we hope to retain our accumulated wealth under\\r\\nsuch conditions?--and finally he abandoned theorizing and argument, and\\r\\nboldly declared his position.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will tell you,\" he concluded, \"what practical means I intend to bring\\r\\nto bear upon the situation. I base my projected action upon this\\r\\ntruism, which is indeed the very kernel of my creed. I say that every\\r\\nman willing and able to work should have work, and I say that it is the\\r\\nduty of legislators to see that he has it. To-day there are one hundred\\r\\nthousand men and women hanging about our streets deteriorating morally\\r\\nand physically through the impossibility of following their trade. I\\r\\nsay that it is time for legislators to inquire into the cause of this,\\r\\nand to remedy it. So I propose to move in the House of Commons, should\\r\\nyour votes enable me to find myself there, that a Royal Commission be\\r\\nimmediately appointed to deal with this matter. And I propose,\\r\\nfurther, to insist that this Commission be composed of manufacturers and\\r\\nbusiness men, and that we dispense with all figure-heads, and I can\\r\\npromise you this, that the first question which shall engage the\\r\\nattention of these men shall be an immediate revision of our tariffs.\\r\\nWe won\\'t have men with theories which work out beautifully on paper, and\\r\\nbring a great country into the throes of commercial ruin. We won\\'t have\\r\\nmen who think that the laws their fathers made are good enough for them,\\r\\nand that all change is dangerous, because Englishmen are sure to fight\\r\\ntheir way through in the long run--a form of commercial Jingoism to\\r\\nwhich I fear we are peculiarly prone. We don\\'t want scholars or\\r\\nstatisticians. We want a commission of plain business men, and I\\r\\npromise you that if we get them, there shall be presented to Parliament\\r\\nbefore I meet you again practical measures which I honestly and firmly\\r\\nbelieve will start a wave of commercial prosperity throughout the\\r\\ncountry such as the oldest amongst you cannot remember. We have the\\r\\ncraftsmen, the capital, and the brains--all that we need is legislation\\r\\nadapted to the hour and not the last century, and we can hold our own\\r\\nyet in the face of the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n              *     *     *     *     *\\r\\n\\r\\nAfterwards, at the political club and at the committee-room, there was\\r\\nmuch excited conversation concerning the effect of Henslow\\'s bold\\r\\ndeclaration. The general impression was, this election was now assured.\\r\\nA shouting multitude followed him to his hotel, popular Sentiment was\\r\\ntouched, and even those who had been facing the difficulty of life with\\r\\na sort of dogged despair for years were raised into enthusiasm. His\\r\\nwords begat hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the committee-room there was much excitement and a good deal of\\r\\nspeculation. Every one realized that the full effect of this daring\\r\\nplunge could not be properly gauged until after it had stood the test of\\r\\nprint. But on the whole comment was strikingly optimistic. Brooks for\\r\\nsome time was absent. In the corridor he had come face to face with\\r\\nMary Scott. Her eyes flashed with pleasure at the sight of him, and she\\r\\nheld out her hand frankly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You heard it all?\" he asked, eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes--every word. Tell me, you understand these things so much better\\r\\nthan I do. Is this an election dodge, or--is he in earnest? Was he\\r\\nspeaking the truth?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The honest truth, I believe,\" he answered, leading her a little away\\r\\nfrom the crowd of people. \"He is of course pressing this matter home\\r\\nfor votes, but he is very much in earnest himself about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you think that he is on the right track?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I really believe so,\" he answered. \"In fact I am strongly in favour of\\r\\nmaking experiments in the direction he spoke of. By the bye, Miss\\r\\nScott, I have something to tell you. You remember telling me about Lord\\r\\nArranmore and his refusal to subscribe to the Unemployed Fund?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has been approached again--the facts have been more fully made\\r\\nknown to him, and he has sent a cheque for one thousand pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe received the news with a coldness which he found surprising.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I can guess,\" she said, quietly, \"who the second applicant was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went to see him myself,\" he admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must be very eloquent,\" she remarked, with a smile which he could\\r\\nnot quite understand. \"A thousand pounds is a great deal of money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is nothing to Lord Arranmore,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Less than nothing,\" she admitted, readily. \"I would rather that he had\\r\\nstopped in the street and given half-a-crown to a hungry child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Still--it is a magnificent gift,\" he declared. \"We can open all our\\r\\nrelief stations again. I believe that you are a little prejudiced\\r\\nagainst Lord Arranmore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I?\" She shrugged her shoulders. \"How should I be? I have never spoken\\r\\na word to him in my life. But I think that he has a hard, cynical face,\\r\\nand a hateful expression.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks disagreed with her frankly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He seems to me,\" he declared, \"like a man who has had a pretty rough\\r\\ntime, and I believe he had in his younger days, but I do not believe\\r\\nthat he is really either hard or cynical. He has some odd views as\\r\\nregards charity, but upon my word they are logical enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, we\\'ll not disagree about him,\" she declared. \"I wonder how long\\r\\nmy uncle means to be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall I find out?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would it be troubling you? He is so excited that I dare say he has\\r\\nforgotten all about me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich was precisely what he had done. Brooks found him the centre of\\r\\nan animated little group, with a freshly-lit cigar in his mouth, and\\r\\nevery appearance of having settled down to spend the night. He was\\r\\nalmost annoyed when Brooks reminded him of his niece.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless my soul, I forgot all about Mary,\" he exclaimed with\\r\\nvexation. \"She must go and sit somewhere. I shan\\'t be ready yet.\\r\\nHenslow wants us to go down to the Bell, and have a bit of supper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In that case,\" Brooks said, \"you had better allow me to take Miss Scott\\r\\nhome, and I will come then to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Capital, if you really don\\'t mind,\" Mr. Bullsom declared. \"Put her in\\r\\na cab. Don\\'t let her be a bother to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks found her reluctant to take him away, but he pleaded a headache,\\r\\nand assured her that his work for the night was over. Outside he led\\r\\nher away from the centre of the town to a quiet walk heading to the\\r\\nsuburb where she lived. Here the streets seemed strangely silent, and\\r\\nBrooks walked hat in hand, heedless of the rain which was still\\r\\nsprinkling. \"Oh, this is good,\" he murmured. \"How one wearies of these\\r\\ncrowds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All the same,\" she answered, smiling, \"I think that your place just now\\r\\nis amongst them, and I shall not let you take me further than the top of\\r\\nthe hill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks looked down at her and laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a very determined person you are,\" he said. \"I will take you to\\r\\nthe top of the hill--and then we will see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\nA TEMPTING OFFER\\r\\n\\r\\nThe small boy brought in the card and laid it on Brooks\\' desk with a\\r\\nflourish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s outside, sir--in Mr. Barton\\'s room. Shall I show him in?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks for a moment hesitated. He glanced at a letter which lay open\\r\\nupon the desk before him, and which he had read and re-read many times.\\r\\nThe boy repeated his inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, of course,\" he answered. \"Show him in at once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore, more than usually immaculate, strolled in, hat in hand,\\r\\nand carefully selecting the most comfortable chair, seated himself on\\r\\nthe other side of the open table at which Brooks was working.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How are you, Brooks?\" he inquired, tersely. \"Busy, of course. An\\r\\naftermath of work, I suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A few months ago,\" Brooks answered, \"I should have considered myself\\r\\ndesperately busy. But after last week anything ordinary in the shape of\\r\\nwork seems restful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must congratulate you, I suppose,\" he remarked. \"You got your man\\r\\nin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We got him in all right,\" Brooks assented. \"Our majority was less than\\r\\nwe had hoped for, though.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was large enough,\" he answered, \"and after all it was a clear gain\\r\\nof a seat to your party, wasn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a seat which we Radicals had a right to,\" Brooks declared. \"Now\\r\\nthat the storm of Imperialism is quieting down and people are beginning\\r\\nto realize that matters nearer home need a little attention, I cannot\\r\\nsee how the manufacturing centres can do anything save return Radicals.\\r\\nWe are the only party with a definite home policy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just so,\" he remarked, indifferently. \"I needn\\'t say that I didn\\'t\\r\\ncome here to talk politics. There was a little matter of business which\\r\\nI wished to put before you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks looked up in some surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Business!\" he repeated, a little vaguely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. As you are aware, Mr. Morrison has had the control of the Enton\\r\\nestates for many years. He was a very estimable man, and he performed\\r\\nhis duties so far as I know quite satisfactorily. Now that he is dead,\\r\\nhowever, I intend to make a change. The remaining partners in his firm\\r\\nare unknown to me, and I at once gave them notice of my intention.\\r\\nWould you care to undertake the legal management of my estates in this\\r\\npart of the world?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks felt the little colour he had leave his cheeks. For a moment he\\r\\nwas quite speechless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I scarcely know how to answer, or to thank you, Lord Arranmore,\" he\\r\\nsaid at last. \"This is such a surprising offer. I scarcely see how you\\r\\ncan be in earnest. You know so little of me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really,\" he said, \"I don\\'t see anything very surprising in it.\\r\\nMorrisons have a large practice, and without the old man I scarcely see\\r\\nhow they could continue to give my affairs the attention they require.\\r\\nYou, on the other hand, are only just starting, and you would be able to\\r\\nwatch over my interests more closely. Then--although I cannot pretend\\r\\nthat I am much influenced by sentimental reasons--still, I knew your\\r\\nfather, and the strangeness of our few years of life as neighbours\\r\\ninclines me to be of service to you provided I myself am not the\\r\\nsufferer. As to that I am prepared to take the risk. You see mine is\\r\\nonly the usual sort of generosity--the sort which provides for an\\r\\nadequate quid pro quo. Of course, if you think that the undertaking of\\r\\nmy affairs would block you in other directions do not hesitate to say\\r\\nso. This is a matter of business between us, pure and simple.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks had recovered himself. The length of Lord Arranmore\\'s speech and\\r\\nhis slow drawl had given him an opportunity to do so. He glanced for a\\r\\nmoment at the letter which lay upon his desk, and hated it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In an ordinary way, Lord Arranmore,\" he answered, \"there could be only\\r\\none possible reply to such an offer as you have made me--an immediate\\r\\nand prompt acceptance. If I seem to hesitate, it is because, first--I\\r\\nmust tell you something. I must make something--in the nature of a\\r\\nconfession.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore raised his eyebrows, but his face remained as the face of\\r\\na Sphinx. He sat still, and waited.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the occasion of my visit to you,\" Brooks continued, \"you may\\r\\nremember the presence of a certain Mr. Lacroix? He is the author, I\\r\\nbelieve, of several books of travel in Western Canada, and has the\\r\\nreputation of knowing that part of the country exceedingly well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks paused, but his visitor helped him in no way. His face wore\\r\\nstill its passive expression of languid inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He spoke of his visit to you,\" Brooks went on \"in Canada, and he twice\\r\\nreiterated the fact that there was no other dwelling within fifty miles\\r\\nof you. He said this upon his own authority, and upon the authority of\\r\\nhis Indian guide. Now it is only a few days ago since you spoke of my\\r\\nfather as living for years within a few miles of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore nodded his head thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! And you found the two statements, of course, irreconcilable.\\r\\nWell, go on!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks found it difficult. He was grasping a paperweight tightly in one\\r\\nhand, and he felt the rising colour burn his cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wrote to Mr. Lacroix,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A perfectly natural thing to do,\" Lord Arranmore remarked, smoothly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd his answer is here!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Suppose you read it to me,\" Lord Arranmore suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks took up the letter and read it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"TRAVELLERS\\' CLUB, December 10.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Replying to your recent letter, I have not the slightest hesitation in\\r\\nreaffirming the statement to which you refer. I am perfectly convinced\\r\\nthat at the time of my visit to Lord Arranmore on the bank of Lake Quo,\\r\\nthere was no Englishman or dwelling-place of any sort within a radius of\\r\\nfifty miles. The information which you have received is palpably\\r\\nerroneous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not refer to Lord Arranmore himself? He would certainly confirm\\r\\nwhat I say, and finally dispose of the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yours sincerely,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"VICTOR LACROIX.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A very interesting letter,\" Lord Arranmore remarked. \"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks crumpled the letter up and flung it into the waste-paper basket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Arranmore,\" he said, \"I made this inquiry behind your back, and in\\r\\na sense I am ashamed of having done so. Yet I beg you to put yourself\\r\\nin my position. You must admit that my father\\'s disappearance from the\\r\\nworld was a little extraordinary. He was a man whose life was more than\\r\\nexemplary--it was saintly. For year after year he worked in the\\r\\npolice-courts amongst the criminal classes. His whole life was one long\\r\\nrecord of splendid devotion. His health at last breaks down, and he is\\r\\nsent by his friends for a voyage to Australia. He never returns. Years\\r\\nafterwards his papers and particulars of his death are sent home from\\r\\none of the loneliest spots in the Empire. A few weeks ago you found me\\r\\nout and told me of his last days. You see what I must believe. That he\\r\\nwilfully deserted his wife and son--myself. That he went into lonely\\r\\nand inexplicable solitude for no apparent or possible reason. That he\\r\\nmisused the money subscribed by his friends in order that he might take\\r\\nthis trip to Australia. Was ever anything more irreconcilable?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From your point of view--perhaps not,\" Lord Arranmore answered. \"You\\r\\nmust enlarge it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you tell me how?\" Brooks demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore stifled a yawn. He had the air of one wearied by a\\r\\nprofitless discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I might certainly suggest a few things. Who was your\\r\\ntrustee or guardian, or your father\\'s man of business?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Ascough, of Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly. Your father saw him, of course, prior to his departure from\\r\\nEngland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, is it not a fact that instead of making a will your father made\\r\\nover by deed of gift the whole of his small income to your mother in\\r\\ntrust for you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, he did that,\" Brooks admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Think that over,\" he remarked. \"Doesn\\'t that suggest his already\\r\\nhalf-formed intention never to return?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It never struck me in that way,\" Brooks answered. \"Yet it is obvious,\"\\r\\nLord Arranmore said. \"Now, I happen to know from your father himself\\r\\nthat he never intended to go to Australia, and he never intended to\\r\\nreturn to England. He sailed instead by an Allan liner from Liverpool\\r\\nto Quebec under the name of Francis. He went straight to Montreal, and\\r\\nhe stayed there until he had spent the greater part of his money. Then\\r\\nhe drifted out west. There is his history for you in a few words.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA sudden light flashed in Brooks\\' eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He told you that he left England meaning never to return? Then you\\r\\nhave the key to the whole thing. Why not? That is what I want to know.\\r\\nWhy not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know,\" Lord Arranmore answered, coolly. \"He never told me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks felt a sudden chill of disappointment. Lord Arranmore rose\\r\\nslowly to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Brooks,\" he said, \"I have told you all that I know. You have\\r\\nasked me a question which I have not been able to answer. I can,\\r\\nhowever, give you some advice which I will guarantee to be\\r\\nexcellent--some advice which you will do well to follow. Shall I go\\r\\non?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you please!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not seek to unravel any further what may seem to you to be the\\r\\nmystery of your father\\'s disappearance from the world. Depend upon it,\\r\\nhis action was of his own free will, and he had excellent reasons for\\r\\nit. If he had wished you to know them he would have communicated with\\r\\nyou. Remember, I was with your father during his last days--and this is\\r\\nmy advice to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks pointed downward to the crumpled ball of paper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That letter!\" he exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I scarcely see its significance,\" he said. \"It is not even my word\\r\\nagainst Lacroix\\'. I sent you all your father\\'s papers, I brought back\\r\\nphotographs and keepsakes known to belong to him. In what possible way\\r\\ncould it benefit me to mislead you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe telephone on Brooks\\' table rang, and for a moment or two he found\\r\\nhimself, with mechanical self-possession, attending to some unimportant\\r\\nquestion. When he replaced the receiver Lord Arranmore had resumed his\\r\\nseat, but was drawing on his gloves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" he said, \"let us resume our business talk. I have made you an\\r\\noffer. What have you to say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks pointed to the waste-paper basket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did a mean action,\" he said. \"I am ashamed of it. Do you mean that\\r\\nyour offer remains open?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" Lord Arranmore answered. \"That little affair is not worth\\r\\nmentioning. I should probably have done the same.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I am not altogether a madman,\" Brooks declared, smiling, \"so I\\r\\nwill only say that I accept your offer gratefully--and I will do my very\\r\\nbest to deserve your confidence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore rose and stood with his hands behind him, looking out of\\r\\nthe window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good,\" he said. \"I will send for Ascough to come down from town,\\r\\nand we must meet one day next week at Morrisons\\' office, and go into\\r\\nmatters thoroughly. That reminds me. Busher, my head bailiff, will be\\r\\nin to see you this afternoon. There are half-a-dozen leases to be seen\\r\\nto at once, and everything had better come here until the arrangements\\r\\nare concluded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall be in all the afternoon,\" Brooks answered, still a little\\r\\ndazed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Thursday,\" Lord Arranmore concluded, \"you dine and sleep at Enton.\\r\\nI hope we shall have a good day\\'s sport. The carriage will fetch you at\\r\\n6:30. Good-morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore walked out with a little nod, but on the threshold he\\r\\npaused and looked back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By the bye, Brooks,\" he said, \"do you remember my meeting you in a\\r\\nlittle tea-shop almost the day after I first called upon you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite well,\" Brooks answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You had a young lady with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. I was with Miss Scott.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore\\'s hand fell from the handle. His eyes seemed suddenly\\r\\nfull of fierce questioning. He moved a step forward into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Scott? Who is she?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks was hopelessly bewildered, and showed it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She lives with her uncle in Medchester. He is a builder and timber\\r\\nmerchant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore was silent for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her father, then, is dead?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He died abroad, I think,\" Brooks answered, \"but I really am not sure.\\r\\nI know very little of any of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore turned away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is the image of a man I once knew,\" he remarked, \"but after all,\\r\\nthe type is not an uncommon one. You won\\'t forget that Busher will be\\r\\nin this afternoon. He is a very intelligent fellow for his class, and\\r\\nyou may find it worth your while to ask him a few questions. Until\\r\\nThursday, then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Until Thursday,\" Brooks repeated, mechanically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\nWHO THE DEVIL IS BROOKS?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be tired,\" declared Sydney Molyneux, sinking into a low couch, \"to\\r\\nbe downright dead dog-tired is the most delightful thing in the world.\\r\\nWill some one give me some tea?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks laughed softly from his place in front of the open fire. A long\\r\\nday in the fresh north wind had driven the cobwebs from his brain, and\\r\\nbrought the burning colour to his cheeks. His eyes were bright, and his\\r\\nlaughter was like music.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you,\" he exclaimed, \"are fresh from electioneering. Why, fatigue\\r\\nlike this is a luxury.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMolyneux lit a cigarette and looked longingly at the tea-tray set out in\\r\\nthe middle of the hall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is all very well,\" he said, \"but there is a wide difference\\r\\nbetween the two forms of exercise. In electioneering one can use one\\'s\\r\\nbrain, and my brain is never weary. It is capable of the most\\r\\nstupendous exertions. It is my legs that fail me sometimes. Here comes\\r\\nLady Caroom at last. Why does she look as though she had seen a ghost?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat great staircase at Enton came right into the hall. A few steps\\r\\nfrom the bottom Lady Caroom had halted, and her appearance was certainly\\r\\na little unusual. Every vestige of colour had left her cheeks. Her\\r\\nright hand was clutching the oak banisters, her eyes were fixed upon\\r\\nBrooks. He was for a moment embarrassed, but he stepped forward to meet\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you do, Lady Caroom?\" he said. \"We are all in the shadows here,\\r\\nand Mr. Molyneux is crying out for his tea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe resumed her progress and greeted Brooks graciously. Almost at the\\r\\nsame moment a footman brought lamps, and the tea was served. Lady\\r\\nCaroom glanced again with a sort of curious nervousness at the young man\\r\\nwho stood by her side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a little earlier than we expected,\" she remarked, seating\\r\\nherself before the tea-tray. \"Here comes Sybil. She is dying to\\r\\ncongratulate you, Mr. Brooks. Is Arranmore here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We left him in the gun-room,\" Molyneux answered. \"He is coming\\r\\ndirectly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil Caroom, in a short skirt and a jaunty hat, came towards Brooks\\r\\nwith outstretched hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Delightful!\" she exclaimed. \"I only wish that it had been nine\\r\\nthousand instead of nine hundred. You deserved it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks laughed heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, we were satisfied to win the seat,\" he declared.\\r\\n\\r\\nMolyneux leaned forward tea-cup in hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you deserved it,\" he remarked. \"Our old man opened his mouth a\\r\\nbit, but yours knocked him silly. Upon my word, I didn\\'t think that any\\r\\none man had cheek stupendous enough to humbug a constituency like\\r\\nHenslow did. It took my breath away to read his speeches.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you really mean that?\" asked Brooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mean it? Of course I do. What I can\\'t understand is how people can\\r\\nswallow such stuff, election after election. Doesn\\'t every Radical\\r\\ncandidate get up and talk in the same maudlin way--hasn\\'t he done so\\r\\nfor the last fifty years? And when he gets into Parliament is there a\\r\\nmore Conservative person on the face of the earth than the Radical\\r\\nmember pledged to social reform? It\\'s the same with your man Henslow.\\r\\nHe\\'ll do nothing! He\\'ll attempt nothing! Silly farce, politics, I\\r\\nthink.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom laughed softly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never heard you so eloquent in my life, Sydney,\" she exclaimed.\\r\\n\"Do go on. It is most entertaining. When you have quite finished I can\\r\\nsee that Mr. Brooks is getting ready to pulverize you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Sybil tells me that Mr. Molyneux is not to be taken seriously,\"\\r\\nhe answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nMolyneux brought up his cup for some more tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you listen to Lady Sybil, Brooks,\" he retorted. \"She is annoyed\\r\\nwith me because I have been spoken of as a future Prime Minister, and\\r\\nshe rather fancies her cousin for the post. Two knobs, please, and\\r\\nplenty of cream. As a matter of fact I am in serious and downright\\r\\nearnest. I say that Henslow won his seat by kidding the working\\r\\nclasses. He promised them a sort of political Arabian Nights. He\\'ll go\\r\\nup to Westminster, and I\\'m open to bet what you like that he makes not\\r\\none serious practical effort to push forward one of the startling\\r\\nmeasures he talked about so glibly. I will trouble you for the toast,\\r\\nBrooks. Thanks!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is always cynical like this,\" Sybil murmured, \"when his party have\\r\\nlost a seat. Don\\'t take any notice of him, Mr. Brooks. I have great\\r\\nfaith in Mr. Henslow, and I believe that he will do his best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMolyneux smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Henslow is a politician,\" he remarked, \"a professional politician.\\r\\nWhat you Radicals want is Englishmen who are interested in politics.\\r\\nHenslow knows how to get votes. He\\'s got his seat, and he\\'ll keep\\r\\nit--till the next election.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Henslow has rather a platform manner,\" he said, \"but he is sound\\r\\nenough. I believe that we are on the eve of important changes in our\\r\\nsocial legislation, and I believe that Henslow will have much to say\\r\\nabout them. At any rate, he is not a rank hypocrite. We have shown him\\r\\nthings in Medchester which he can scarcely forget in a hurry. He will\\r\\ngo to Westminster with the memory of these things before him, with such\\r\\na cry in his ears as no man can stifle. He might forget if he\\r\\nwould--but he never will. We have shown him things which men may not\\r\\nforget.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore, who had now joined the party, leaned forward with his\\r\\narm resting lightly upon Lady Caroom\\'s shoulder. An uneasy light\\r\\nflashed in his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are men,\" he said, \"whom you can never reach, genial men with a\\r\\nready smile and a prompt cheque-book, whose selfishness is an armour\\r\\nmore potent than the armour of my forefather there, Sir Ronald Kingston\\r\\nof Arranmore. And, after all, why not? The thoroughly selfish man is\\r\\nthe only person logically who has the slightest chance of happiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is true,\" Molyneux murmured. \"Delightfully true.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Arranmore is always either cynical or paradoxical,\" Sybil Caroom\\r\\ndeclared. \"He really says the most unpleasant things with the greatest\\r\\nappearance of truth of any man I know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This company,\" Lord Arranmore remarked lightly, \"is hostile to me. Let\\r\\nus go and play pool.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom rose up promptly. Molyneux groaned audibly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall play me at billiards instead,\" she declared. \"I used to give\\r\\nyou a good game once, and I have played a great deal lately. Ring for\\r\\nAnnette, will you, Sybil? She has my cue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil Caroom made room for Brooks by her side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do sit down and tell me more about the election,\" she said. \"Sydney is\\r\\nsure to go to sleep. He always does after shooting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall ask me questions,\" he suggested. \"I scarcely know what part\\r\\nof it would interest you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey talked together lightly at first, then more seriously. From the\\r\\nother end of the hall came the occasional click of billiard balls. Lady\\r\\nCaroom and her host were playing a leisurely game interspersed with\\r\\nconversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is this young Mr. Brooks?\" she asked, pausing to chalk her cue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A solicitor from Medchester,\" he answered. \"He was Parliamentary agent\\r\\nfor Henslow, and I am going to give him a management of my estates.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is quite a boy,\" she remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twenty-six or seven,\" he answered. \"How well you play those cannons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ought to. I had lessons for years. Is he a native of Medchester?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore was blandly puzzled. She finished her stroke and turned\\r\\ntowards him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Brooks, you know. We were talking of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course we were,\" he answered. \"I do not think so. He is an orphan.\\r\\nI met his father in Canada.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He reminds me of some one,\" she remarked, in a puzzled tone. \"Just now\\r\\nas I was coming downstairs it was almost startling. He is a\\r\\ngood-looking boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be careful not to foul,\" he admonished her. \"You should have the\\r\\nspider-rest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom made a delicate cannon from an awkward place, and concluded\\r\\nher break in silence. Then she leaned with her back against the table,\\r\\nchalking her cue. Her figure was still the figure of a girl she was a\\r\\nremarkably pretty woman. She laid her slim white fingers upon his\\r\\ncoat-sleeve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder,\" she said, softly, \"whether you will ever tell me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you look at me like that,\" he answered, smiling, \"I shall tell\\r\\nyou--a great many things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eyes fell. It was too absurd at her age, but her cheeks were\\r\\nburning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t improve a bit,\" she declared. \"You were always too apt with\\r\\nyour tongue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I practiced in a good school,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me,\" she sighed. \"For elderly people what a lot of rubbish we\\r\\ntalk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shivered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a hideous word,\" he remarked. \"You make me feel that my chest is\\r\\npadded and my hair dyed. If to talk sense is a sign of youth, let us do\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By all means. When are you going to find me a husband for Sybil?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well--is there any hurry?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lots! We are going to Fernshire next week, and the place is always\\r\\nfull of young men. If you have anything really good in your mind I\\r\\ndon\\'t want to miss it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took up his cue and scored an excellent break. She followed suit,\\r\\nand he broke down at an easy cannon. Then he came over to her side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you like Mr. Brooks?\" he asked, quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He seems a nice boy,\" she answered, lightly. He remained silent.\\r\\nSuddenly she looked up into his face, and clutched the sides of the\\r\\ntable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You--you don\\'t mean that?\" she murmured, suddenly pale to the lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe led her to a chair. The game was over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some day,\" he whispered, \"I will tell you the whole story.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n              *     *     *     *     *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Even to think of these things,\" Sybil said, softly, \"makes us feel very\\r\\nselfish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No one is ever hopelessly selfish who is conscious of it,\" he answered,\\r\\nsmiling. \"And, after all, it would not do for every one to be always\\r\\nbrooding upon the darker side of life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In another minute,\" Molyneux exclaimed, waking up with a start, \"I\\r\\nshould have been asleep. Whatever have you two been talking about? It\\r\\nwas the most soothing hum I ever heard in my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Brooks was telling me of some new phases of life,\" she answered.\\r\\n\"It is very interesting, even if it is a little sad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMolyneux eyed them both for a moment in thoughtful silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"H\\'m!\" he remarked. \"Dinner is the next phase of life which will\\r\\ninterest me. Has the dressing-bell gone yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You gross person,\" she exclaimed. \"You ate so much tea you had to go\\r\\nto sleep.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was the exercise, he insisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have been standing about all day. I heard you ask for a place\\r\\nwithout any walking, and where as few people as possible could see you\\r\\nmiss your birds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your ears are a great deal too sharp,\" he said. \"It was the wind,\\r\\nthen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind what it was,\" she answered, laughing. \"You can go to sleep\\r\\nagain if you like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMolyneux put up his eyeglass and looked from one to the other. He saw\\r\\nthat Sybil\\'s interest in her companion\\'s conversation was not assumed,\\r\\nand for the first time he appreciated Brooks\\' good looks. He shook off\\r\\nhis sleepiness at once and stood by Sybil\\'s side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you been trying to convert Lady Sybil?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is unnecessary,\" she answered, quickly. \"Mr. Brooks and I are on\\r\\nthe same side.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed softly and strolled away. Lord Arranmore was standing\\r\\nthoughtfully before the marking-board. He laid his hand upon his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say, Arranmore,\" he asked, \"who the devil is Brooks?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BULLSOM GIVES A DINNER-PARTY\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless my soul!\" Mr. Bullsom exclaimed. \"Listen to this.\" Mrs.\\r\\nBullsom, in a resplendent new dress, looking shinier and fatter than\\r\\never, was prepared to listen to anything which might relieve the tension\\r\\nof the moment. For it was the evening of the dinner-party, and within\\r\\nten minutes of the appointed time. Mr. Bullsom stood under the\\r\\nincandescent light and read aloud \"The shooting-party at Enton yesterday\\r\\nconsisted of the Marquis of Arranmore, the Hon. Sydney Molyneux, Mr.\\r\\nHennibul, K.C., and Mr. Kingston Brooks. Notwithstanding the high wind\\r\\nan excellent bag was obtained.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! Our Mr. Kingston Brooks?\" Selina exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s Brooks, right enough,\" Mr. Bullsom exclaimed. \"I called at his\\r\\noffice yesterday, and they told me that he was out for the day. Well,\\r\\nthat licks me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, who was reading a magazine in a secluded corner, looked up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw Mr. Brooks in the morning,\" she remarked. \"He told me that he\\r\\nwas going to Enton to dine and sleep.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina looked at her cousin sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You saw Mr. Brooks?\" she repeated. \"Where?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I met him,\" Mary answered, coolly. \"He told me that Lord Arranmore had\\r\\nbeen very kind to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why didn\\'t you tell us?\" Louise asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I really didn\\'t think of it,\" Mary answered. \"It didn\\'t strike me as\\r\\nbeing anything extraordinary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not when he\\'s coming here to dine to-night,\" Selina repeated, \"and is a\\r\\nfriend of papa\\'s! Why, Mary, what nonsense.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I really don\\'t see anything to make a fuss about,\" Mary said, going\\r\\nback to her magazine.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom drew himself up, and laid down the paper with the paragraph\\r\\nuppermost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it is most gratifying to think that I gave that young man his\\r\\nfirst start,\" he remarked. \"I believe, too, that he is not likely to\\r\\nforget it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The bell!\" Mrs. Bullsom exclaimed, with a little gasp. \"Some one has\\r\\ncome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, if they have, there\\'s nothing to be frightened about,\" Mr.\\r\\nBullsom retorted. \"Ain\\'t we expecting them to come? Don\\'t look so\\r\\nscared, Sarah! Take up a book, or something. Why, bless my soul,\\r\\nyou\\'re all of a tremble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t help it, Peter,\" Mrs. Bullsom replied, nervously. \"I don\\'t\\r\\nknow these people scarcely a bit, and I\\'m sure I shall do something\\r\\nfoolish. Selina, be sure you look at me when I\\'m to come away, and--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Kingston Brooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks, ushered in by a neighbouring greengrocer, entered upon a scene\\r\\nof unexpected splendour. Selina and her sister were gorgeous in green\\r\\nand pink respectively. Mr. Bullsom\\'s shirt-front was a thing to wonder\\r\\nat. There was an air of repressed excitement about everybody, except\\r\\nMary, who welcomed him with a quiet smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not much too early, I hope,\" Brooks remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re in the nick of time,\" Mr. Bullsom assured him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks endeavoured to secure a chair near Mary, which attempt Selina\\r\\nadroitly foiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ve been reading all about your grandeur, Mr. Brooks,\" she\\r\\nexclaimed. \"What a beautiful day you must have had at Enton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks looked puzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was very enjoyable,\" he declared. \"I wanted to see you, Miss\\r\\nScott,\" he added, turning to Mary. \"I think that we can arrange that\\r\\ndate for the lecture now. How would Wednesday week do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Admirably!\" Mary answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know whom you take in, Mr. Brooks?\" Selina interrupted.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks glanced at the card in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Seventon,\" he said. \"Yes, thanks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina looked up at him with an arch smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Seventon is most dreadfully proper,\" she said. \"You will have to\\r\\nbe on your best behaviour. Oh, here comes some one. What a bother!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an influx of guests. Mrs. Bullsom, reduced to a state of\\r\\nchaotic nervousness, was pushed as far into the background as possible\\r\\nby her daughters, and Mr. Bullsom, banished from the hearth where he\\r\\nfelt surest of himself, plunged into a conversation with Mr. Seventon\\r\\non the weather. Brooks leaned over towards Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wednesday week at eight o\\'clock, then,\" he said. \"I want to have a\\r\\nchat with you about the subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not now,\" she interposed. \"You know these people, don\\'t you, and the\\r\\nHuntingdons? Go and talk to them, please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks laughed, and went to the rescue. He won Mrs. Bullsom\\'s eternal\\r\\ngratitude by diverting Mrs. Seventon\\'s attention from her, and thereby\\r\\nallowing her a moment or two to recover herself. Somehow or other a\\r\\nbuzz of conversation was kept up until the solemn announcement of\\r\\ndinner. And when she was finally seated in her place, and saw a couple\\r\\nof nimble waiters, with the greengrocer in the back, looking cool and\\r\\ncapable, she felt that the worst was over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solemn process of sampling doubtful-looking entries and eating\\r\\nsaddle of mutton to the tune of a forced conversation was got through\\r\\nwithout disaster. Mrs. Bullsom felt her fat face break out into\\r\\nsmiles. Mr. Bullsom, though he would like to have seen everybody go\\r\\ntwice for everything, began to expand. He had already recited the story\\r\\nof Kingston Brooks\\' greatness to both of his immediate neighbours, and\\r\\nin a casual way mentioned his early patronage of that remarkable young\\r\\nman. And once meeting his eye he raised his glass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not quite up to the Enton vintage, Brooks, eh? but all right, I hope.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks nodded back, and resumed his conversation. Selina took the\\r\\nopportunity to mention casually to her neighbour, Mr. Huntingdon, that\\r\\nMr. Brooks was a great friend of Lord Arranmore\\'s, and Louise, on her\\r\\nside of the table, took care also to disseminate the same information.\\r\\nEverybody was properly impressed. Mr. Bullsom decided to give a\\r\\ndinner-party every month, and to double the greengrocer\\'s tip, and by\\r\\nthe time Selina\\'s third stage whisper had reached her mother and the\\r\\nladies finally departed, he was in a state of geniality bordering upon\\r\\nbeatitude. There was a general move to his end of the table. Mr.\\r\\nBullsom started the port, and his shirt-front grew wider and wider. He\\r\\nlit a cigar, and his thumb found its way to the armhole of his\\r\\nwaistcoat. At that moment Mr. Bullsom would not have changed places\\r\\nwith any man on earth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What sort of a place is Enton to stay at, Brooks, eh?\" he inquired, in\\r\\na friendly manner. \"Keeps it up very well, don\\'t he, the present\\r\\nMarquis?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I really don\\'t know much about it,\" he answered, \"I was only there one\\r\\nnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good day\\'s sport?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good indeed,\" Brooks answered. \"Lord Arranmore is a wonderful\\r\\nshot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A remarkable man in a great many ways, Lord Arranmore,\" Dr. Seventon\\r\\nremarked. \"He disappeared from London when he was an impecunious young\\r\\nbarrister with apparently no earthly chance of succeeding to the\\r\\nArranmore estates, and from that time till a few years ago, when he was\\r\\nadvertised for, not a soul knew his whereabouts. Even now I am told\\r\\nthat he keeps the story of all these years absolutely to himself. No\\r\\none knew where he was, or how he supported himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can tell you where he was for some time, at any rate,\" Brooks said.\\r\\n\"He was in Canada, for he met my father there, and was with him when he\\r\\ndied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed,\" Dr. Seventon remarked. \"Then I should say that you are one\\r\\nof the only men in England to whom he has opened his lips on the\\r\\nsubject. Do you know what he was doing there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fishing and shooting, I think.\" Brooks answered. \"It was near Lake\\r\\nOno, right out west, and there would be nothing else to take one there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was always supposed too that he had spent most of the time in a\\r\\nsituation in New York,\" Mr. Huntingdon said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know a man,\" Mr. Seaton put in, \"who can swear that he met him as a\\r\\nsergeant in the first Australian contingent of mounted infantry sent to\\r\\nthe Cape.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are no end of stories about him,\" Dr. Seventon remarked. \"If I\\r\\nwere the man I would put a stop to them by telling everybody exactly\\r\\nwhere I was during those twenty years or so. It is a big slice of one\\'s\\r\\nlife to seal up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Still, there is not the slightest reason why he should take the whole\\r\\nworld into his confidence, is there?\" Brooks expostulated. \"He is not a\\r\\npublic man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A peer of England with a seat in the House of Lords must always be a\\r\\npublic man to some extent,\" Mr. Huntingdon remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not sure,\" Brooks remarked, \"that the lives of all our hereditary\\r\\nlegislators would bear the most searching inquiry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s right, Brooks,\" Mr. Bullsom declared.  \"Stick up for your pals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks looked a little annoyed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The only claim I have upon Lord Arranmore\\'s acquaintance,\" he remarked,\\r\\n\"is his kindness to my father. I hope, Dr. Seventon, that you are\\r\\ngoing to press the matter of that fever hospital home. I have a little\\r\\ninformation which I think you might make use of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks changed his place, wine-glass in hand, and the conversation\\r\\ndrifted away. But he found the position of social star one which the\\r\\nBullsoms were determined to force upon him, for they had no sooner\\r\\nentered the drawing-room than Selina came rushing across the room to him\\r\\nand drew him confidentially on one side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Brooks,\" she said, \"do go and talk to Mrs. Huntingdon. She is so\\r\\nanxious to hear about the Lady Caroom who is staying at Enton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know nothing about Lady Caroom,\" Brooks replied, without any overplus\\r\\nof graciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina looked at him in some dismay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you met her at Enton, didn\\'t you?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, I met her there,\" Brooks answered, impatiently. \"But I\\r\\ncertainly don\\'t know enough of her to discuss her with Mrs. Huntingdon.\\r\\nI rather wanted to speak to your cousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina\\'s thin little lips became compressed, and for a moment she forgot\\r\\nto smile. Her cousin indeed! Mary, who was sitting there in a plain\\r\\nblack gown without a single ornament, and not even a flower, looking for\\r\\nall the world like the poor relation she was! Selina glanced downwards\\r\\nat the great bunch of roses and maidenhair fern in her bosom, at the\\r\\nfancy and beaded trimming which ran like a nightmare all over her new\\r\\ngown, and which she was absolutely certain had come from Paris; at the\\r\\nheavy gold bracelets which concealed some part of her thin arms; she\\r\\nremembered suddenly the aigrette in her hair, such a finish to her\\r\\ncostume, and her self-confidence returned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, don\\'t bother about Mary now. Mrs. Huntingdon is dying to have you\\r\\ntalk to her. Please do and if you like--I will give you one of my roses\\r\\nfor your button-hole.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks stood the shock gallantly, and bowed his thanks. He had met Mrs.\\r\\nHuntingdon before, and they talked together for a quarter of an hour or\\r\\nso.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I knew why you were here,\" was almost her first question.\\r\\n\"Isn\\'t it all funny?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bullsom has always been very decent to me,\" he answered. \"It is\\r\\nthrough him I was appointed agent to Mr. Henslow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, business! I see,\" she answered, shrugging her shoulders. \"Same\\r\\nhere. I\\'m a doctor\\'s wife, you know. Did you ever see such awful\\r\\ngirls! and who in the name of all that\\'s marvellous can be their\\r\\ndressmaker?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bullsom is a very good sort indeed,\" Brooks answered. \"I have a great\\r\\nrespect for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe made a little face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'s the nice-looking girl in black with her hair parted in the\\r\\nmiddle?\" she asked. \"Mr. Bullsom\\'s niece. She is quite charming, and\\r\\nmost intelligent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me!\" Mrs. Huntingdon remarked. \"I had no idea she had anything\\r\\nto do with the family. Sort of a Cinderella look about her now you\\r\\nmention it. Couldn\\'t you get her to come over and talk to me? I\\'m\\r\\nhorribly afraid of Mrs. Bullsom. She\\'ll come out of that dress if\\r\\nshe tries to talk, and I know I shall laugh.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sure I can,\" Brooks answered, rising with alacrity. \"I\\'ll bring\\r\\nher over in a minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had just finished arranging a card-table when Brooks drew her on\\r\\none side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About that subject!\" he began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall scarcely have time to talk about it now, shall we?\" she\\r\\nanswered. \"You will be wanted to play cards or something. We shall be\\r\\nquite content to leave it to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like to talk it over with you,\" he said. \"Do tell me when I\\r\\nmay see you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down, and he stood by her chair. \"Really, I don\\'t know,\" she\\r\\nanswered. \"Perhaps I shall be at home when you pay your duty call.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come and have some tea at Mellor\\'s with me to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe seemed not to hear him. She had caught Mrs. Seventon\\'s eye across\\r\\nthe room, and rose to her feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have left Mrs. Seventon alone all the evening,\" she said. \"I must\\r\\ngo and talk to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood before her--a little insistent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall expect you at half-past four,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, no. I have an engagement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The next day, then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you! I would rather you did not ask me. I have a great deal to\\r\\ndo just now. I will bring the girls to the lecture.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wednesday week,\" he protested, \"is a long way off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can go over to Enton,\" she laughed, \"and get some more cheques from\\r\\nyour wonderful friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder,\" he remarked, \"why you dislike Lord Arranmore so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Instinct perhaps--or caprice,\" she answered, lightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The latter for choice,\" he answered. \"I don\\'t think that he is a man\\r\\nto dislike instinctively. He rather affected me the other way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was suddenly graver.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is foolish of me,\" she remarked. \"You will think so too, when I\\r\\ntell you that my only reason is because of a likeness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A likeness!\" he repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is exactly like a man who was once a friend of my father\\'s, and who\\r\\ndid him a great deal of harm. My father was much to blame, I know, but\\r\\nthis man had a great influence over him, and a most unfortunate one.\\r\\nNow don\\'t you think I\\'m absurd?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think it is a little rough on Lord Arranmore,\" he answered, \"don\\'t\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be if my likes or dislikes made the slightest difference to\\r\\nhim,\" she answered. \"As it is, I don\\'t suppose it matters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was this in England?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, it was abroad--in Montreal. I really must go to Mrs. Seventon.\\r\\nShe looks terribly bored.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks made no effort to detain her. He was looking intently at a\\r\\ncertain spot in the carpet. The coincidence--it was nothing more, of\\r\\ncourse--was curious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII\\r\\n\\r\\nCHARITY THE \"CRIME\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere followed a busy time for Brooks, the result of which was a very\\r\\nmarked improvement in his prospects. For the younger Morrison and his\\r\\npartner, loth to lose altogether the valuable Enton connection, offered\\r\\nBrooks a partnership in their firm. Mr. Ascough, who was Lord\\r\\nArranmore\\'s London solicitor, and had been Brooks\\' guardian, after\\r\\ncareful consideration advised his acceptance, and there being nothing in\\r\\nthe way, the arrangements were pushed through almost at once. Mr.\\r\\nAscough, on the morning of his return to London, took the opportunity\\r\\nwarmly to congratulate Brooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Arranmore has been marvellously kind to me,\" Brooks agreed. \"To\\r\\ntell you the truth, Mr. Ascough, I feel almost inclined to add\\r\\nincomprehensibly kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe older man stroked his grey moustache thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Arranmore is eccentric,\" he remarked. \"Has always been eccentric,\\r\\nand will remain so, I suppose, to the end of the chapter. You are the\\r\\none who profits, however, and I am very glad of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eccentricity,\" Brooks remarked, \"is, of course, the only obvious\\r\\nexplanation of his generosity so far as I am concerned. But it has\\r\\noccurred to me, Mr. Ascough, to wonder whether the friendship or\\r\\nconnection between him and my father was in any way a less slight thing\\r\\nthan I have been led to suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Ascough shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Arranmore,\" he said, \"has told you, no doubt, all that there is to\\r\\nbe told.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks sat at his desk, frowning slightly, and tapping the\\r\\nblotting-paper with a pen-holder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All that Lord Arranmore has told me,\" he said, \"is that my father\\r\\noccupied a cabin not far from his on the banks of Lake Ono, that they\\r\\nsaw little of each other, and that he only found out his illness by\\r\\naccident. That my father then disclosed his name, gave him his papers\\r\\nand your address. There was merely the casual intercourse between two\\r\\nEnglishmen coming together in a strange country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is what I have always understood,\" Mr. Ascough agreed. \"Have\\r\\nyou any reason to think otherwise?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No definite reason--except Lord Arranmore\\'s unusual kindness to me,\"\\r\\nBrooks remarked. \"Lord Arranmore is one of the most self-centred men I\\r\\never knew--and the least impulsive. Why, therefore, he should go out of\\r\\nhis way to do me a kindness I cannot understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If this is really an enigma to you,\" Mr. Ascough answered, \"I cannot\\r\\nhelp you to solve it. Lord Arranmore has been the reverse of\\r\\ncommunicative to me. I am afraid you must fall back upon his lordship\\'s\\r\\neccentricity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Ascough rose, but Brooks detained him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have plenty of time for your train,\" he said. \"Will you forgive me\\r\\nif I go over a little old ground with you--for the last time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lawyer resumed his seat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am in no hurry,\" he said, \"if you think it worth while.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My father came to you when he was living at Stepney--a stranger to\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A complete stranger,\" Mr. Ascough agreed. \"I had never seen him\\r\\nbefore in my life. I did a little trifling business for him in\\r\\nconnection with his property.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He told you nothing of his family or relatives?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He told me that he had not a relation in the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You knew him slightly, then?\" Brooks continued, \"all the time he was in\\r\\nLondon? And when he left for that voyage he came to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He made over his small income then to my mother in trust for me. Did\\r\\nit strike you as strange that he should do this instead of making a\\r\\nwill?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not particularly,\" Mr. Ascough declared. \"As you know, it is not an\\r\\nunusual course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It did not suggest to you any determination on his part never to return\\r\\nto England?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He left England on friendly terms with my mother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly. She and he were people for whom I and every one who knew\\r\\nanything of their lives had the highest esteem and admiration.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can imagine no reason, then, for my father leaving England for\\r\\ngood?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know of no reason why he should have abandoned his trip to\\r\\nAustralia and gone to Canada?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His doing so is as inexplicable to you as to me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Entirely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have never doubted Lord Arranmore\\'s story of his death?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never. Why should I?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One more question,\" Brooks said. \"Do you know that lately I have met a\\r\\ntraveller--a man who visited Lord Arranmore in Canada, and who declared\\r\\nto his certain knowledge there was no other human dwelling-house within\\r\\nfifty miles of Lord Arranmore\\'s cabin?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was obviously mistaken.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou think so?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is certain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My question,\" he said, \"will have given you some idea of the\\r\\nuncertainty I have felt once or twice lately, owing to the report of the\\r\\ntraveller Lacroix, and Lord Arranmore\\'s unaccountable kindness to me.\\r\\nYou see, he isn\\'t an ordinary man. He is not a philanthropist by any\\r\\nmeans, nor in any way a person likely to do kindly actions from the love\\r\\nof them. Now, do you know of any facts, or can you suggest anything\\r\\nwhich might make the situation clearer to me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot, Mr. Brooks,\" the older man answered, without hesitation.\\r\\n\"If you take my advice, you will not trouble yourself any more with\\r\\nfancies which seem to me--pardon me--quite chimerical. Accept Lord\\r\\nArranmore\\'s kindness as the offshoot of some sentimental feeling which\\r\\nhe might well have entertained towards a fellow-countryman by whose\\r\\ndeath-bed he had stood in that far-away, lonely country. You may even\\r\\nyourself be mistaken in Lord Arranmore\\'s character, and you can\\r\\nremember, too, that after all what means so much to you costs him\\r\\nnothing--is probably for his own advantage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks rose and took up his hat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very much obliged to you, Mr. Ascough,\" he said. \"Yours, after\\r\\nall, is the common-sense view of the affair. If you like I will walk up\\r\\nto the station. I am going that way. . . .\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Brooks, convinced of their folly, finally discarded certain\\r\\nuncomfortable thoughts which once or twice lately had troubled him. He\\r\\ndined at Enton that night, and improved his acquaintance with Lady\\r\\nCaroom and her daughter, who were still staying there. Although this\\r\\nwas not a matter which he had mentioned to Mr. Ascough, there was\\r\\nsomething which he found more inexplicable even than Lord Arranmore\\'s\\r\\ntransference of the care of his estates to him, and that was the\\r\\napparent encouragement which both he and Lady Caroom gave to the\\r\\nfriendship between Sybil and himself. They had lunched with him twice\\r\\nin Medchester, and more often still the Enton barouche had been kept\\r\\nwaiting at his office whilst Lady Caroom and Sybil descended upon him\\r\\nwith invitations from Lord Arranmore. After his talk with Mr. Ascough\\r\\nhe put the matter behind him, but it remained at times an inexplicable\\r\\npuzzle.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the evening of this particular visit he found Sybil alone in a recess\\r\\nof the drawing-room with a newspaper in her hand. She greeted him with\\r\\nobvious pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do come and tell me about things, Mr. Brooks,\" she begged. \"I have\\r\\nbeen reading the local paper. Is it true that there are actually people\\r\\nstarving in Medchester?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a great deal of distress,\" he admitted, gravely. \"I am afraid\\r\\nthat it is true.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him with wide-open eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t understand,\" she said. \"I thought that there were\\r\\nsocieties who dealt with all that sort of thing, and behind, the--the\\r\\nworkhouse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So there are, Lady Sybil,\" he answered, \"but you must remember that\\r\\nsocieties are no use unless people will subscribe to them, and that\\r\\nthere are a great many people who would sooner starve than enter the\\r\\nworkhouse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But surely,\" she exclaimed, \"there is no difficulty about getting\\r\\nmoney--if people only understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe watched her for a moment in silence--suddenly appreciating the\\r\\nrefinement, the costly elegance which seemed in itself to be a part of\\r\\nthe girl, and yet for which surely her toilette was in some way also\\r\\nresponsible. Her white satin dress was cut and fashioned in a style\\r\\nwhich he was beginning to appreciate as evidence of skill and\\r\\ncostliness. A string of pearls around her throat gleamed softly in the\\r\\nfirelight. A chain of fine gold studded with opals and diamonds reached\\r\\nalmost to her knees. She wore few rings indeed, but they were such\\r\\nrings as he had never seen before he had come as a guest to Enton. And\\r\\nthere were thousands like her. A momentary flash of thought carried him\\r\\nback to the days of the French Revolution. There was a print hanging in\\r\\nhis room of a girl as fair and as proud as this one, surrounded by a\\r\\nfierce rabble mad with hunger and the pent-up rage of generations,\\r\\ntearing the jewels from her fingers, tearing even, he thought, the\\r\\ntrimming from her gown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do not answer me, Mr. Brooks,\" she reminded him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe recovered himself with a start.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, Lady Sybil. Your question set me thinking. We have\\r\\ntried to make people understand, and many have given most generously,\\r\\nbut for all that we cannot cope with such distress as there is to-day in\\r\\nMedchester. I am secretary for one of the distribution societies, and\\r\\nI have seen things which are enough to sadden a man for life, only\\r\\nduring the last few days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have seen people--really hungry?\" she asked, with something like\\r\\ntimidity in her face.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed bitterly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That we see every moment of the time we spend down amongst them,\" he\\r\\nanswered. \"I have seen worse things. I have seen the sapping away of\\r\\ncharacter--men become thieves and women worse--to escape from\\r\\nstarvation. That, I think, is the greatest tragedy of all. It makes\\r\\none shudder when one thinks that on the shoulders of many people some\\r\\nportion of the responsibility at any rate for these things must rest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer lips quivered. She emptied the contents of a gold chain purse into\\r\\nher hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is we who are wicked, Mr. Brooks,\" she said, \"who spend no end of\\r\\nmoney and close our ears to all this. Do take this, will you; can it go\\r\\nto some of the women you know, and the children? There are only five or\\r\\nsix pounds there, but I shall talk to mamma. We will send you a\\r\\ncheque.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took the money without hesitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very glad,\" he said, earnestly, \"that you have given me this, that\\r\\nyou have felt that you wanted to give it me. I hope you won\\'t think too\\r\\nbadly of me for coming over here to help you spend a pleasant evening,\\r\\nand talking at all of such miserable things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Badly!\" she repeated. \"No; I shall never be able to thank you enough\\r\\nfor telling me what you have done. It makes one feel almost wicked to\\r\\nbe sitting here, and wearing jewelry, and feeling well off, spending\\r\\nmoney on whatever you want, and to think that there are people starving.\\r\\nHow they must hate us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is the wonderful part of it,\" he answered. \"I do not believe that\\r\\nthey do. I suppose it is a sort of fatalism--the same sort of thing,\\r\\nonly much less ignoble, as the indifference which keeps our rich people\\r\\ncontented and deaf to this terribly human cry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are young,\" she said, looking at him, \"to be so much interested in\\r\\nsuch serious things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is my blood, I suppose,\" he answered. \"My father was a police-court\\r\\nmissionary, and my mother the matron of a pauper hospital.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are both dead, are they not?\" she asked, softly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Many years ago,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom and Lord Arranmore came in together. A certain unusual\\r\\nseriousness in Sybil\\'s face was manifest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You two do not seem to have been amusing yourselves,\" Lady Caroom\\r\\nremarked, giving her hand to Brooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Brooks has been answering some of my questions about the poor\\r\\npeople,\" Sybil answered, \"and it is not an amusing subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore laughed lightly, and there was a touch of scorn in the\\r\\nslight curve of his fine lips and his raised eyebrows. He stood away\\r\\nfrom the shaded lamplight before a great open fire of cedar logs, and\\r\\nthe red glow falling fitfully upon his face seemed to Brooks, watching\\r\\nhim with more than usual closeness, to give him something of a\\r\\nMephistopheles aspect. His evening clothes hung with more than ordinary\\r\\nprecision about his long slim body, his black tie and black pearl stud\\r\\nsupplied the touch of sombreness so aptly in keeping with the mirthless,\\r\\nbitter smile which still parted his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must not take Mr. Brooks too seriously on the subject of the poor\\r\\npeople,\" he said, the mockery of his smile well matched in his tone.\\r\\n\"Brooks is an enthusiast--one, I am afraid, of those misguided people\\r\\nwho have barred the way to progress for centuries. If only they could\\r\\nbe converted!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, dear, how enigmatic!\" she exclaimed. \"Do be a little more\\r\\nexplicit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear lady,\" he continued, turning to her, \"it is not worth while. Yet\\r\\nI sometimes wonder whether people realize how much harm this hysterical\\r\\nphilanthropy--this purely sentimental faddism, does; how it retards the\\r\\nnatural advance of civilization, throws dust in people\\'s eyes, salves\\r\\nthe easy conscience of the rich man, who bargains for immortality with a\\r\\nfew strokes of the pen, and finds mischievous occupation for a good many\\r\\nweak minds and parasitical females. Believe me, that all personal\\r\\ncharity is a mistake. It is a good deal worse than that. It is a\\r\\ncrime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil rose up, and a little unusual flush had stained her cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I still do not understand you in the least, Lord Arranmore,\" she said.\\r\\n\"It seems to me that you are making paradoxical and ridiculous\\r\\nstatements, which only bewilder us. Why is charity a crime? That is\\r\\nwhat I should like to hear you explain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore bowed slightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had no idea,\" he said, leaning his elbow upon the mantelpiece, \"that\\r\\nI was going to be inveigled into a controversy. But, my dear Sybil, I\\r\\nwill do my best to explain to you what I mean, especially as at your age\\r\\nyou are not likely to discover the truth for yourself. In the first\\r\\nplace, charity of any sort is the most insidious destroyer of moral\\r\\ncharacter which the world has ever known. The man who once accepts it,\\r\\neven in extremes, imbibes a poison from which his system can never be\\r\\nthoroughly cleansed. You let him loose upon society, and the evil which\\r\\nyou have sown in him spreads. He is like a man with an infectious\\r\\ndisease. He is a source of evil to the community. You have relieved a\\r\\nphysical want, and you have destroyed a moral quality. I do not need to\\r\\npoint out to you that the balance is on the wrong side.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil glanced across at Brooks, and he smiled back at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Arranmore has not finished yet,\" he said. \"Let us hear the\\r\\nworst.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir host smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After all,\" he said, \"why do I waste my breath? From the teens to the\\r\\nthirties sentiment smiles. It is only later on in life that reason has\\r\\nany show at all. Yet you should ask yourselves, you eager self-denying\\r\\nyoung people, who go about with a healthy moral glow inside because you\\r\\nhave fed the poor, or given an hour or so of your time to the\\r\\ndistribution of reckless charity-you should ask yourselves: What is the\\r\\nactual good of ministering to the outward signs of an internal disease?\\r\\nYou are simply trying to renovate the outside when the inside is filthy.\\r\\nDon\\'t you see, my dear young people, that to give a meal to one starving\\r\\nman may be to do him indeed good, but it does nothing towards\\r\\npreventing another starving man from taking his place to-morrow. You\\r\\nstimulate the disease, you help it to spread. Don\\'t you see where\\r\\ninstead you should turn--to the social laws, the outcome of which is\\r\\nthat starving man? You let them remain unharmed, untouched, while you\\r\\nfall over one another in frantic efforts to brush away to-day\\'s effect\\r\\nof an eternal cause. Let your starving man die, let the bones break\\r\\nthrough his skin and carry him up--him and his wife and their children,\\r\\nand their fellows--to your House of Commons. Tell them that there are\\r\\nmore to-morrow, more the next day, let the millions of the lower classes\\r\\nlook this thing in the face. I tell you that either by a revolution,\\r\\nwhich no doubt some of us would find worse than inconvenient, or by less\\r\\ndrastic means, the thing would right itself. You, who work to relieve\\r\\nthe individual, only postpone and delay the millennium. People will\\r\\nkeep their eyes closed as long as they can. It is you who help them to\\r\\ndo so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dinner is served, my lord,\" the butler announced.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore extended his arm to Lady Caroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" he said, \"let us all be charitable to one another, for I too am\\r\\nstarving.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV\\r\\n\\r\\nAN AWKWARD QUESTION\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You think they really liked it, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could they help it? It was such a delightful idea of yours, and I\\r\\nam sure all that you said was so simple and yet suggestive. Good-night,\\r\\nMr. Brooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stood in the doorway of the Secular Hall, where Brooks had just\\r\\ndelivered his lecture. It seemed to him that her farewell was a little\\r\\nabrupt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was going to ask,\" he said, \"whether I might not see you home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really,\" she said, \"I wish you would not trouble. It is quite a long\\r\\nway, and I have only to get into a car.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The further the better,\" he answered, \"and besides, if your uncle is at\\r\\nhome I should like to come in and see him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe made no further objection, yet Brooks fancied that her acquiescence\\r\\nwas, to some extent, involuntary. He walked by her side in silence for\\r\\na moment or two, wondering whether there was indeed any way in which he\\r\\ncould have offended her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not seen you,\" he remarked, \"since the evening of your\\r\\ndinner-party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You were out when I called.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have so many things to do--just now. We can get a car here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is too full,\" he said. \"Let us walk on for a little way. I want to\\r\\ntalk to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe car was certainly full, so after a moment\\'s hesitation she\\r\\nacquiesced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will bring your girls again, I hope?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They will come I have no doubt,\" she answered. \"So will I if I am in\\r\\nMedchester.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are going away?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope so,\" she answered. \"I am not quite sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not for good?\" Possibly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Won\\'t you tell me about it?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well--I don\\'t know!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will tell you if you like,\" she said, doubtfully. \"But I do not wish\\r\\nanything said about it at present, as my arrangements are not complete.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will be most discreet,\" he promised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been doing a little work for a woman\\'s magazine in London, and\\r\\nthey have half promised me a definite post on the staff. I am to hear\\r\\nin a few days as to the conditions. If they are satisfactory--that is\\r\\nto say, if I can keep myself on what they offer--I shall go and live in\\r\\nLondon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was surprised, and also in a sense disappointed. It was astonishing\\r\\nto find how unpleasant the thought of her leaving Medchester was to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had no idea of this,\" he said, thoughtfully. \"I did not know that\\r\\nyou went in for anything of the sort.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My literary ambitions are slight enough,\" she answered. \"Yet you can\\r\\nscarcely be surprised that I find the thought of a definite career and a\\r\\ncertain amount of independence attractive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stole a sidelong glance at her. In her plainly made clothes and quiet\\r\\nhat she was scarcely, perhaps, a girl likely to attract attention, yet\\r\\nhe was conscious of certain personal qualities, which he had realized\\r\\nand understood from the first. She carried herself well, she walked\\r\\nwith the free graceful movements of a well-bred and healthy girl. In\\r\\nher face was an air of quiet thought, the self-possession of the woman\\r\\nof culture and experience. Her claim to good looks was, after all,\\r\\nslight enough, yet on studying her he came to the conclusion that she\\r\\ncould if she chose appear to much greater advantage. Her hair, soft and\\r\\nnaturally wavy, was brushed too resolutely back; her smile, which was\\r\\nalways charming, she suffered to appear only at the rarest intervals.\\r\\nShe suggested a life of repression, and with his knowledge of the\\r\\nBullsom menage he was able to surmise some glimmering of the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are right,\" he declared. \"I think that I can understand what your\\r\\nfeeling must be. I am sure I wish you luck.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe touch of sympathy helped her to unbend. She glanced towards him\\r\\nkindly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" she said. \"Of course there will be difficulties. My uncle\\r\\nwill not like it. He is very good-natured and very hospitable, and I am\\r\\nafraid his limitations will not permit him to appreciate exactly how I\\r\\nfeel about it. And my aunt is, of course, merely his echo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He will not be unreasonable,\" Brooks said. \"I am sure of that. For a\\r\\nman who is naturally of an obstinate turn of mind I think your uncle is\\r\\nwonderful. He makes great efforts to free himself from all prejudices.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unfortunately,\" she remarked, \"he is very down on the independent\\r\\nwoman. He would make housekeepers and cooks of all of us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely,\" he protested, with a quiet smile, \"your cousins are more\\r\\nambitious than that. I am sure Selina would never wear a cooking-apron,\\r\\nunless it had ribbon and frilly things all over it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After all, they have been kind to me,\" she said. \"My mother was the\\r\\nblack sheep of the family, and when she died Mr. Bullsom paid my\\r\\npassage home, and insisted upon my coming to live here as one of the\\r\\nfamily. I should hate them to think that I am discontented, only the\\r\\nthings which satisfy them do not satisfy me, so life sometimes becomes a\\r\\nlittle difficult.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you friends in London?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None! I tried living there when I first came back for a few weeks, but\\r\\nit was impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will be very lonely, surely. London is the loneliest of all great\\r\\ncities.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should I not make friends?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is what I too asked myself years ago when I was articled there,\"\\r\\nhe answered. \"Yet it is not so easy as it sounds. Every one seems to\\r\\nhave their own little circle, and a solitary person remains so often\\r\\njust outside. Yet if you have friends--and tastes--London is a\\r\\nparadise. Oh, how fascinating I used to find it just at first--before\\r\\nthe chill came. You, too, will feel that. You will be content at first\\r\\nto watch, to listen, to wonder! Every type of humanity passes before\\r\\nyou like the jumbled-up figures of a kaleidoscope. You are content even\\r\\nto sit before a window in a back street--and listen. What a sound that\\r\\nis--the roar of London, the voices of the street, the ceaseless hum, the\\r\\ncreaking of the great wheel of humanity as it goes round and round. And\\r\\nthen, perhaps, in a certain mood the undernote falls upon your ear, the\\r\\nbitter, long-drawn-out cry of the hopeless and helpless. When you have\\r\\nonce heard it, life is never the same again. Then, if you do not find\\r\\nfriends, you will know what misery is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were both silent for a few minutes. A car passed them unnoticed.\\r\\nThen she looked at him curiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For a lawyer,\" she remarked, \"you are a very imaginative person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, well, I was talking just then of how I felt in those days. I was a\\r\\nboy then, you know. I dare say I could go back now to my old rooms and\\r\\nlive there without a thrill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What one has once felt,\" she murmured, \"comes back always.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes only the echo,\" he answered, \"and that is weariness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked for a little way in silence. Then she spoke to him in an\\r\\naltered tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard a good deal about you during the last few weeks,\" she\\r\\nsaid. \"You are very much to be congratulated, they tell me. I am sure\\r\\nI am very glad that you have been so fortunate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" he answered. \"To tell you the truth, it all seems very\\r\\nmarvellous to me. Only a few months ago your uncle was almost my only\\r\\nclient of importance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Arranmore was your father\\'s friend though, was he not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They came together abroad,\" he answered, \"and Lord Arranmore was with\\r\\nmy father when he died in Canada.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stopped short.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In Canada, on the banks of Lake Ono, if you know where that is,\" he\\r\\nanswered, looking at her in surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe resumed her usual pace, but he noticed that she was pale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So Lord Arranmore was in Canada?\" she said. \"Do you know how long\\r\\nago?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About ten years, I suppose,\" he answered. \"How long before that I do\\r\\nnot know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was silent for several minutes, and they found themselves in the\\r\\ndrive leading to the Bullsom villa. Brooks was curious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder,\" he asked, \"whether you will tell me why you are interested\\r\\nin Lord Arranmore--and Canada?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was born in Montreal,\" she answered, \"and I once saw some one very\\r\\nmuch like Lord Arranmore there. But I am convinced that it could only\\r\\nhave been a resemblance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mentioned it before--when we saw him in Mellor\\'s,\" he remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it struck me then,\" she admitted. \"But I am sure that Lord\\r\\nArranmore could not have been the person whom I am thinking about. It\\r\\nis ridiculous of me to attach so much importance to a mere likeness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stood upon the doorstep, but she checked him as he reached out for\\r\\nthe bell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have seen quite a good deal of him,\" she said. \"Tell me what you\\r\\nthink of Lord Arranmore.\" His hand fell to his side. He stood under the\\r\\ngas-bracket, and she could see his face distinctly. There was a slight\\r\\nfrown upon his forehead, a look of trouble in his grey eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You could not have asked me a more difficult question,\" he admitted.\\r\\n\"Lord Arranmore has been very kind to me, although my claim upon him has\\r\\nbeen of the slightest. He is very clever, almost fantastic, in some of\\r\\nhis notions; he is very polished, and his manners are delightful. He\\r\\nwould call himself, I believe, a philosopher, and he is, although it\\r\\nsounds brutal for me to say so, very selfish. And behind it all I\\r\\nhaven\\'t the faintest idea what sort of a man he is. Sometimes he gives\\r\\none the impression of a strong man wilfully disguising his real\\r\\ncharacteristics, for hidden reasons; at others, he is like one of those\\r\\nbrilliant Frenchmen of the last century, who toyed and juggled with\\r\\nwords and phrases, esteeming it a triumph to remain an unread letter\\r\\neven to their intimates. So you see, after all,\" he wound up, \"I cannot\\r\\ntell you what I think of Lord Arranmore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can ring the bell,\" she said. \"You must come in for a few\\r\\nminutes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir entrance together seemed to cause the little family party a\\r\\ncertain amount of disturbed surprise. The girls greeted Brooks with a\\r\\ngreat show of pleasure, but they looked doubtfully at Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you meet at the front door?\" Selina asked. \"I thought I heard\\r\\nvoices.\" Brooks was a little surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your cousin brought her class of factory girls to my lecture to-night\\r\\nat the Secular Hall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina\\'s eyes narrowed a little, and she was silent for a moment. Then\\r\\nshe turned to her cousin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You might have told us, Mary,\" she exclaimed, reproachfully. \"We\\r\\nshould so much have liked to come, shouldn\\'t we, Louise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course we should,\" Louise answered, snappishly. \"I can\\'t think why\\r\\nMary should go off without saying a word.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary looked at them both and laughed. \"Well,\" she said, \"I have left\\r\\nthe house at precisely the same time on \\'Wednesday evenings all through\\r\\nthe winter, and neither of you have said anything about coming with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is quite different,\" Selina answered, cuttingly. \"We should very\\r\\nmuch have enjoyed Mr. Brooks\\' lecture. Do tell us what it was about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you be bothered, Brooks,\" Mr. Bullsom exclaimed, hospitably.\\r\\n\"Sit down and try one of these cigars. We\\'ve had supper, but if you\\'d\\r\\nlike anything--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing to eat, thanks,\" Brooks protested. \"I\\'ll have a cigar if I\\r\\nmay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And a whisky-and-soda, then,\" Mr. Bullsom insisted. \"Say when!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks turned to Selina. Mary had left the room. \"You were asking\\r\\nabout the lecture,\" he said. \"Really, it was only a very unpretentious\\r\\naffair, and to tell you the truth, only intended for people whose\\r\\nopportunities for reading have not been great. I am quite sure it would\\r\\nnot have been worth your while to come down. We just read a chapter or\\r\\nso from A Tale of Two Cities, and talked about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We should have liked it very mulch,\" Selina declared. \"Do tell us when\\r\\nthere is another one, will you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With pleasure,\" he answered. \"I warn you, though, that you will be\\r\\ndisappointed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will risk that,\" Selina declared, with a smile. \"Have you been to\\r\\nEnton this week?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was there on Sunday,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is that beautiful girl, Lady Sybil Caroom, still staying there?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"Is she very beautiful, by the bye?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I thought men would think so,\" Selina said, hastily. \"I think\\r\\nthat she is just a little loud, don\\'t you, Louise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLouise admitted that the idea had occurred to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And her hair--isn\\'t it badly dyed?\" Selina remarked. \"Such a pity.\\r\\nIt\\'s all in patches.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think girls ought not to make up in the street, either,\" Louise\\r\\nremarked, primly. \"A little powder in the house is all very\\r\\nwell\"--(Louise had a nose which gave her trouble)--\"but I really don\\'t\\r\\nthink it looks respectable in the street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose,\" Selina remarked, \"you men admire all that sort of thing,\\r\\ndon\\'t you?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I really hadn\\'t noticed it with Lady Sybil,\" Brooks admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Men are so blind,\" she remarked. \"You watch next time you are close to\\r\\nher, Mr. Brooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will,\" he promised. \"I\\'ll get her between me and a window in a\\r\\nstrong north light.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be too unkind,\" she said. \"That\\'s the worst of you men. When\\r\\nyou do find anything out you are always so severe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After all, though,\" Louise remarked, with a sidelong glance, \"it must\\r\\nbe very, very interesting to meet these sort of people, even if one\\r\\ndoesn\\'t quite belong to their set. I should think you must find every\\r\\none else quite tame, Mr. Brooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can assure you I don\\'t,\" he answered, coolly. \"This evening has\\r\\nprovided me with quite as pleasant society as ever I should wish for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina beamed upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Mr. Brooks, you are terrible. You do say such things!\" she\\r\\ndeclared, archly.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouise laughed a little hardly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We mustn\\'t take too much to ourselves, dear,\" she said. \"Remember that\\r\\nMr. Brooks walked all the way up from the Secular Hall with Mary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom threw down his paper with a little impatient exclamation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, come!\" he said. \"I want to have a few words with Brooks myself,\\r\\nif you girls\\'ll give me a chance. Heard anything from Henslow lately,\\r\\neh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks leaned forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not a word!\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom grunted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"H\\'m! He\\'s taken his seat, and that\\'s all he does seem to have done. To\\r\\nhave heard his last speech here before polling time you would have\\r\\nimagined him with half-a-dozen questions down before now. He\\'s letting\\r\\nthe estimates go by, too. There are half-a-dozen obstructors, all\\r\\nfaddists, but Henslow, with a real case behind him, is sitting tight.\\r\\n\\'Pon my word, I\\'m not sure that I like the fellow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ventured to write to him the other evening,\" Brooks said, \"and I have\\r\\nsent him all the statistics we promised, he seems to have regarded my\\r\\nletter as an impertinence, though, for he has never answered it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mark my words,\" Mr. Bullsom said, doubling the paper up and\\r\\nbringing it down viciously upon his knee, \"Henslow will never sit again\\r\\nfor Medchester. There was none too mulch push about him last session,\\r\\nbut he smoothed us all over somehow. He\\'ll not do it again. I\\'m losing\\r\\nfaith in the man, Brooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks was genuinely disturbed. His own suspicions had been gathering\\r\\nstrength during the last few weeks. Henslow had been pleasant enough,\\r\\nbut a little flippant after the election. From London he had promised\\r\\nto write to Mr. Bullsom, as chairman of his election committee, mapping\\r\\nout the course of action which, in pursuance of his somewhat daring\\r\\npledges, he proposed to embark upon. This was more than a month ago,\\r\\nand there had come not a single word from him. All that vague distrust\\r\\nwhich Brooks had sometimes felt in the man was rekindled and increased,\\r\\nand with it came a flood of bitter thoughts. Another opportunity then\\r\\nwas to be lost. For seven years longer these thousands of pallid,\\r\\nheart-weary men and women were to suffer, with no one to champion their\\r\\ncause. He saw again that sea of eager faces in the market-place, lit\\r\\nwith a sudden gleam of hope as they listened to the bold words of the\\r\\nman who was promising them life and hope and better things. Surely if\\r\\nthis was a betrayal it was an evil deed, not passively to be borne.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom had refreshed himself with whisky-and-water, and decided\\r\\nthat pessimism was not a healthy state of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you what it is, Brooks,\" he said, more cheerfully. \"We mustn\\'t\\r\\nbe too previous in judging the fellow. Let\\'s write him civilly, and if\\r\\nnothing comes of it in a week or two, we will run up to London, you and\\r\\nme, eh? and just haul him over the coals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are right, Mr. Bullsom,\" Brooks said. \"There is nothing we can do\\r\\nfor the present.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please don\\'t talk any more horrid politics,\" Selina begged. \"We want\\r\\nMr. Brooks to give us a lesson at billiards. Do you mind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks rose at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall be charmed!\" he declared.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom rose also.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pooh, pooh!\" he said. \"Brooks and I will have a hundred up and you can\\r\\nwatch us. That\\'ll be lesson enough for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina made a little grimace, but they all left the room together. In\\r\\nthe hall a housemaid was speaking at the telephone, and a moment\\r\\nafterwards she laid the receiver down and came towards them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a message for Mr. Brooks, sir, from the Queen\\'s Hotel. Lord\\r\\nArranmore\\'s compliments, and the ladies from Enton are at the theatre\\r\\nthis evening, and would be glad if Mr. Brooks would join them at the\\r\\nQueen\\'s Hotel for supper at eleven o\\'clock.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks hesitated, but Mr. Bullsom spoke up at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Off you go, Brooks,\" he said, firmly. \"Don\\'t you go refusing an\\r\\ninvitation like that. Lord Arranmore is a bit eccentric, they say, and\\r\\nhe isn\\'t the sort of man to like refusals. You\\'ve just got time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They had the message two hours ago, and have been trying everywhere to\\r\\nfind Mr. Brooks,\" the housemaid added.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina helped him on with his coat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you come another evening soon and play billiards with us?\" she\\r\\nasked, dropping her voice a little.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With pleasure,\" Brooks answered. \"Do you mind saying good-bye to your\\r\\ncousin for me? I am sorry not to see her again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV\\r\\n\\r\\nA SUPPER-PARTY AT THE \"QUEEN\\'S\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks was shown into a private room at the Queen\\'s Hotel, and he\\r\\ncertainly had no cause to complain of the warmth of his welcome. Lady\\r\\nSybil, in fact, made room for him by her side, and he fancied that there\\r\\nwas a gleam of reproach in her eyes as she looked up at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is Medchester really so large a place that one can get lost in it?\" she\\r\\nasked. \"Lord Arranmore has been sending messengers in every direction\\r\\never since we decided upon our little excursion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I telephoned to your office, sent a groom to your rooms and to the\\r\\nclub, and at last we had given you up,\" Lord Arranmore remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I,\" Sybil murmured, \"was in a shocking bad temper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very good of you all,\" Brooks remarked, cheerfully. \"I left the\\r\\noffice rather early, and have been giving a sort of lecture to-night at\\r\\nthe Secular Hall. Then I went up to have a game of billiards with Mr.\\r\\nBullsom. Your telephone message found me there. You must remember that\\r\\neven if Medchester is not a very large place I am a very unimportant\\r\\nperson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me, what modesty,\" Lady Caroom remarked, laughing. \"To us,\\r\\nhowever, you happened to be very important. I hate a party of three.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks helped himself to a quail, and remembered that he was hungry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is very unusual dissipation, isn\\'t it?\" he asked. \"I never\\r\\ndreamed that you would be likely to come into our little theatre.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was Sybil\\'s doings,\" Lady Caroom answered. \"She declared that she\\r\\nwas dull, and that she had never seen A /Message from Mars./ I think\\r\\nthat all that serious talk the other evening gave her the blues.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am always dull in the winter when there is no hunting,\" Sybil\\r\\nremarked. \"This frost is abominable. I have not forgotten our talk\\r\\neither. I feel positively wicked every time I sip champagne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our young philanthropist will reassure you,\" Arranmore remarked, drily.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder how it is,\" she murmured, \"that one\\'s conscience and one\\'s\\r\\ndigestion both grow weaker as one grows old. You and I, Arranmore, are\\r\\ncontent to accept the good things of the earth as they come to us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With me,\" he answered, \"it is the philosophy of approaching old age,\\r\\nbut you have no such excuse. With you it must be sheer callousness.\\r\\nYou are in an evil way, Lady Caroom. Do have another of these quails.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very rude,\" she answered, \"and extremely unsympathetic. But I\\r\\nwill have another quail.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not Want to destroy your appetite, Mr. Brooks,\" Lady Sybil said,\\r\\n\"but this is--if not a farewell feast, something like it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her with sudden interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are going away?\" he exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very soon,\" she assented. \"We were so comfortable at Enton, and the\\r\\nhunting has been so good, that we cut out one of our visits. Mamma\\r\\ndeveloped a convenient attack of influenza. But the next one is very\\r\\nnear now, and our host is almost tired of us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore was for a moment silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have made Enton,\" he said, \"intolerable for a solitary man. When\\r\\nyou go I go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish you could say whither instead of when,\" Lady Caroom answered.\\r\\n\"How bored you would be at Redcliffe. It is really the most outlandish\\r\\nplace we go to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why ever do we accept, mamma?\" Sybil asked. \"Last year I nearly cried\\r\\nmy eyes out, I was so dull. Not a man fit to talk to, or a horse fit to\\r\\nride. The girls bicycle, and Lord Redcliffe breeds cattle and talks\\r\\nturnips.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they all drink port after dinner,\" Lady Caroom moaned; \"but we have\\r\\nto go, dear. We must live rent free somewhere during these months to\\r\\nget through the season.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil looked at Brooks with laughter in her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aren\\'t we terrible people?\" she whispered. \"You are by way of being\\r\\nliterary, aren\\'t you? You should write an article on the shifts of the\\r\\naristocracy. Mamma and I could supply you with all the material. The\\r\\nreal trouble, of course, is that I don\\'t marry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fancy glorying in your failure,\" Lady Caroom said, complacently.\\r\\n\"Three seasons, Arranmore, have I had to drag that girl round. I\\'ve\\r\\nwashed my hands of her now. She must look after herself. A girl who\\r\\nrefuses one of the richest young men in England because she didn\\'t like\\r\\nhis collars is incorrigible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was not his collars, mother,\" Sybil objected. \"It was his neck. He\\r\\nwas always called \\'the Giraffe.\\' He had no head and all neck--the most\\r\\nfatuous person, too. I hate fools.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is where you lack education, dear,\" Lady Caroom answered. \"A fool\\r\\nis the most useful person--for a husband.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil glanced towards Brooks with a little sigh, and, catching a glimpse\\r\\nof his expression, burst out laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mother, you must really not let your tongue run away with you. Mr.\\r\\nBrooks is believing every word you say. You needn\\'t,\" she murmured in a\\r\\ndiscreet undertone. \"Mother and I chaff one another terribly, but we\\'re\\r\\nreally very nicely-behaved persons--for our station in life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Caroom has such a delightfully easy way of romancing,\" Brooks\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s quite true,\" she answered. \"She ought to write the prospectuses\\r\\nfor gold mines and things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore smiled across the table at Brooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This,\" he said, \"is what I have had to endure for the last six weeks.\\r\\nDo you wonder that I am getting balder, or that I set all my people to\\r\\nwork tonight to try and find some one to suffer with me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'ll be so dull when we\\'ve gone,\" Lady Caroom sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ve no idea how we\\'ve improved him,\" Sybil murmured. \"He used to\\r\\nread Owen Meredith after dinner, and go to sleep. By the bye, where are\\r\\nyou going when we leave Enton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I really am not sure,\" he said. \"You have alarmed me. Don\\'t\\r\\ngo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear man,\" she said, \"we must! I daren\\'t offend the Redcliffes.\\r\\nHe\\'s my trustee, and he\\'ll never let me overdraw a penny unless I\\'m\\r\\ncivil to him. If I were you I should go to the Riviera. We\\'ll lend\\r\\nyou our cottage at Lugiano. It has been empty for a year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come and be hostess,\" he said. \"I promise you that I will not hesitate\\r\\nthen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head towards Sybil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can I marry that down there?\" she demanded. \"No young men who are\\r\\nreally respectable go abroad at this time of the year. They are all\\r\\nhunting or shooting. The Riviera is thronged with roues and invalids\\r\\nand adventurers, and we don\\'t want any of them. Dear me, what\\r\\nsacrifices a grown-up daughter does entail. This coming season shall be\\r\\nyour last, Sybil. I won\\'t drag on round again. I\\'m really getting\\r\\nashamed of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Isn\\'t she dreadful?\" Sybil murmured to Brooks. \"I hope you will come\\r\\nto Enton before we leave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very kind of you, Lady Sybil,\" Brooks said, \"but you must\\r\\nremember that I am not like most of the men you meet. I have to work\\r\\nhard, especially just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if I were you I would be thankful for it,\" she said, warmly. \"From\\r\\nour point of view, at any rate, there is nothing so becoming to a man as\\r\\nthe fact that he is a worker. Sport is an excellent thing, but I detest\\r\\nyoung men who do nothing else but shoot and hunt and loaf about. It\\r\\nseems to me to destroy character where work creates it. All the same, I\\r\\nhope you will find an opportunity to come to Enton and say good-bye to\\r\\nus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks was suddenly conscious that it would be no pleasant thing to say\\r\\ngood-bye to Lady Sybil. He had never known any one like her, so\\r\\nperfectly frank and girlish, and yet with character enough underneath\\r\\nin her rare moments of seriousness. More than ever he was struck with\\r\\nthe wonderful likeness between mother and daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will come at any time I am asked,\" he answered, quietly, \"but I am\\r\\nsorry that you are going.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had finished supper, and had drawn their chairs around the fire.\\r\\nArranmore was smoking a cigarette, and Brooks took one from his case.\\r\\nThe carriage was ordered in a quarter of an hour. Brooks found that he\\r\\nand Sybil were a little apart from the others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, I am sorry too,\" she declared. \"Of course it has been\\r\\nmuch quieter at Enton than most of the houses we go to, and we only came\\r\\nat first, I think, because many years ago my mother and Lord Arranmore\\r\\nwere great friends, and she fancied that he was shutting himself up\\r\\ntoo much. But I have enjoyed it very much indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her curiously. He was trying to appreciate what a life of\\r\\nrefined pleasure which she must live would really be like--how\\r\\nsatisfying--whether its limitations ever asserted themselves. Sybil was\\r\\na more than ordinarily pretty girl, but her face was as smooth as a\\r\\nchild\\'s. The Joie de vivre seemed to be always in her eyes. Yet there\\r\\nwere times, as he knew, when she was capable of seriousness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad,\" he said, \"Lord Arranmore will miss you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed at him, her eyebrows raised, a challenge in her bright eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I add that I also shall?\" he whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may,\" she answered. \"In fact, I expected it. I am not sure that I\\r\\ndid not ask for it. And that reminds me. I want you to do me a favour,\\r\\nif you will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anything I can do for you,\" he answered, \"you know will give me\\r\\npleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed softly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is wonderful how you have improved,\" she murmured. \"I want you to\\r\\ngo and see Lord Arranmore as often as you can. We are both very fond of\\r\\nhim really, mamma especially, and you know that he has a very strange\\r\\ndisposition. I am convinced that solitude is the very worst thing for\\r\\nhim. I saw him once after he had been alone for a month or two, and\\r\\nreally you would not have known him. He was as thin as a skeleton,\\r\\nstrange in his manner, and he had that sort of red light in his eyes\\r\\nsometimes which always makes me think of mad people. He ought not to be\\r\\nalone at all, but the usual sort of society only bores him. You will do\\r\\nwhat you can, won\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I promise you that most heartily,\" Brooks declared. \"But you must\\r\\nremember, Lady Sybil, that after all it is entirely in his hands. He\\r\\nhas been most astonishingly kind to me, considering that I have no\\r\\nmanner of claim upon him. He has made me feel at home at Enton, too,\\r\\nand been most thoughtful in every way. For, after all, you see I am\\r\\nonly his man of business. I have no friends much, and those whom I\\r\\nhave are Medchester people. You see I am scarcely in a position to\\r\\noffer him my society. But all the same, I will take every opportunity I\\r\\ncan of going to Enton if he remains there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thanked him silently. Lady Caroom was on her feet, and Sybil and\\r\\nshe went out for their wraps. Lord Arranmore lit a fresh cigarette and\\r\\nsent for his bill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By the bye, Brooks,\" he remarked, \"one doesn\\'t hear much of your man\\r\\nHenslow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bullsom and I were talking about it this evening,\" Brooks\\r\\nanswered. \"We are getting a little anxious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have had seven years of him. You ought to know what to expect.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The war has blocked all legislation,\" Brooks said. \"It has been the\\r\\nusual excuse. Henslow was bound to wait. He would have done the\\r\\nparticular measures which we are anxious about more harm than good if he\\r\\nhad tried to force them upon the land. But now it is different. We are\\r\\nwriting to him. If nothing comes of it, Mr. Bullsom and I are going up\\r\\nto see him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are young to politics, Brooks,\" he remarked, \"yet I should scarcely\\r\\nhave thought that you would have been imposed upon by such a man as\\r\\nHenslow. He is an absolute fraud. I heard him speak once, and I read\\r\\ntwo of his speeches. It was sufficient. The man is not in earnest. He\\r\\nhas some reason, I suppose, for wishing to write M.P. after his name,\\r\\nbut I am perfectly certain that he has not the slightest idea of\\r\\ncarrying out his pledges to you. You will have to take up politics,\\r\\nBrooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed--a little consciously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some day,\" he said, \"the opportunity may come. I will confess that\\r\\nit is amongst my ambitions. But I have many years\\' work before me yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore paid the bill, and they joined the women. As Brooks\\r\\nstood bareheaded upon the pavement Arranmore turned towards him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must have a farewell dinner,\" he said. \"How would to-morrow suit\\r\\nyou--or Sunday?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like to walk over on Sunday, if I might,\" Brooks answered,\\r\\npromptly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall expect you to lunch. Good-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carriage drove off. Brooks walked thoughtfully through the silent\\r\\nstreets to his rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI\\r\\n\\r\\nUNCLE AND NIECE\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom was an early riser, and it chanced that, as was frequently\\r\\nthe case, on the morning following Brooks\\' visit he and Mary sat down\\r\\nto breakfast together. But when, after a cursory glance through his\\r\\nletters, he unfolded the paper, she stopped him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Uncle,\" she said, \"I want to talk to you for a few minutes, if I may.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go ahead,\" he answered. \"No fear of our being interrupted. I shall\\r\\nspeak to those girls seriously about getting up. Now, what is it?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to earn my own living, uncle,\" she said, quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked over his spectacles at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to earn my own living,\" she repeated. \"I have been looking\\r\\nabout for a means of doing so, and I think that I have succeeded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom took off his spectacles and wiped them carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Earn your own living, eh!\" he repeated. \"Well! Go on!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary leaned across the table towards him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t think that I am not grateful for all you have done for me,\\r\\nuncle,\" she said. \"I am, indeed. Only I have felt lately that it was\\r\\nmy duty to order my life a little differently. I am young and strong,\\r\\nand able to work. There is no reason why I should be a burden upon any\\r\\none.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe found his quietness ominous, but she did not flinch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not accomplished enough for a governess, or good-tempered enough\\r\\nfor a companion,\" she continued, \"but I believe I have found something\\r\\nwhich I can do. I have written several short stories for a woman\\'s\\r\\nmagazine, and they have made me a sort of offer to do some regular work\\r\\nfor them. What they offer would just keep me. I want to accept.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where should you live?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In London!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Alone?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a girls\\' club in Chelsea somewhere. I should go there at\\r\\nfirst, and then try and share rooms with another girl.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How much a week will they give you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twenty-eight shillings, and I shall be allowed to contribute regularly\\r\\nto the magazine at the usual rates. I ought to make at least forty\\r\\nshillings a week.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this owing to any disagreement between you and the girls?\" he asked,\\r\\nsharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not,\" she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You ain\\'t unhappy here? Is there anything we could do? I don\\'t want\\r\\nto lose you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was touched. She had expected ridicule or opposition. This was\\r\\nmore difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I am not unhappy,\" she answered. \"You and aunt have been\\r\\nboth of you most generous and kind to me. But I do feel that a busy\\r\\nlife--and I\\'m not a bit domestic, you know would be good for me. I\\r\\nbelieve, uncle, if you were in my place you would feel just like me. If\\r\\nyou were able to, I expect you\\'d want to earn your own living.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall go!\" he said, decidedly. \"I\\'ll help you all I can. You\\r\\nshall have a bit down to buy furniture, if you want it, or an allowance\\r\\ntill you feel your way. But, Mary, I\\'m downright sorry. No, I\\'m not\\r\\nblaming you. You\\'ve a right to go. I--I don\\'t believe I\\'d live here if\\r\\nI were you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very good, uncle,\" Mary said, gratefully. \"And you must\\r\\nremember it isn\\'t as though I were leaving you alone. You have the\\r\\ngirls.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I have the girls. Look here, Mary,\" he added,\\r\\nsuddenly, looking her in the face, \"I want to have a word with you. I\\'m\\r\\ngoing to talk plainly. Be honest with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course,\" she murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s about the girls. It\\'s a hard thing to say, but somehow--I\\'m a bit\\r\\ndisappointed with them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him in something like amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, disappointed,\" he continued. \"That\\'s the word. I\\'m an uneducated\\r\\nman myself--any fool can see that--but I did all I could to have them\\r\\ngirls different. They\\'ve been to the best school in Medchester, and\\r\\nthey\\'ve been abroad. They\\'ve had masters in most everything, and I\\'ve\\r\\nhad \\'em taught riding and driving, and all that sort of thing, properly.\\r\\nThen as they grew up I built this \\'ouse, and came up to live here\\r\\namongst the people whom I reckoned my girls\\'d be sure to get to know.\\r\\nAnd the whole thing\\'s a damned failure, Mary. That\\'s the long and short\\r\\nof it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps--a little later on\" Mary began, hesitatingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t interrupt me,\" he said, brusquely. \"This is the first honest\\r\\ntalk I\\'ve ever had about it, and it\\'s doing me good. The girls\\'d like\\r\\nto put it down to your mother and me, but I don\\'t believe it. I\\'m\\r\\nashamed to say it, but I\\'m afraid it\\'s the girls themselves. There\\'s\\r\\nsomething not right about them, but I\\'m blessed if I know what it is.\\r\\nTheir mother and I are a bit vulgar, I know, but I\\'ve done my best to\\r\\ncopy those who know how to behave--and I believe we\\'d get through for\\r\\nwhat we are anywhere without giving offence. But my girls oughtn\\'t to\\r\\nbe vulgar. It\\'s education as does away with that, and I\\'ve filled em\\r\\nchock-full of education from the time they were babies. It\\'s run out of\\r\\nthem, Mary, like the sands through an hour-glass. They can speak\\r\\ncorrectly, and I dare say they know all the small society tricks. But\\r\\nthat isn\\'t everything. They don\\'t know how to dress. They can spend\\r\\njust as much as they like, and then you can come into the room in a\\r\\nblack gown as you made yourself, and you look a lady, and they don\\'t.\\r\\nThat\\'s the long and short of it. The only decent people who come to\\r\\nthis house are your friends, and they come to see you. There\\'s young\\r\\nBrooks, now. I\\'ve no son, Mary, and I\\'m fond of young men. I never\\r\\nknew one I liked as I like him. My daughters are old enough to be\\r\\nmarried, and I\\'d give fifty thousand pounds to have him for a son-in-law.\\r\\nAnd, of course, he won\\'t look at \\'em. He sees it. He\\'ll talk to you.\\r\\nHe takes no more notice of them than is civil. They fuss round him, and\\r\\nall that, but they might save themselves the pains. It\\'s hard lines,\\r\\nMary. I\\'m making money as no one knows on. I could live at Enton and\\r\\nafford it. But what\\'s the good of it? If people don\\'t care to know us\\r\\nhere, they won\\'t anywhere. Mary, how was it education didn\\'t work with\\r\\nthem girls? Your mother was my own sister, and she married a\\r\\ngentleman. He was a blackguard, but hang it, Mary, if I were you I\\'d\\r\\nsooner be penniless and as you are than be my daughters with five\\r\\nthousand apiece.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an embarrassed silence. Then Mary faced the situation boldly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Uncle,\" she said, \"you are asking my advice. Is that it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If there\\'s any advice you can give, for God\\'s sake let\\'s have it. But\\r\\nI don\\'t know as you can make black white.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Selina and Louise are good girls enough,\" she said, \"but they are a\\r\\nlittle spoilt, and they are a little limited in their ideas. A town\\r\\nlike this often has that effect. Take them abroad, uncle, for a year,\\r\\nor, better still, if you can find the right person, get a companion for\\r\\nthem--a lady--and let her live in the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s sound!\" he answered. \"I\\'ll do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And about their clothes, uncle. Take them up to London, go to one of\\r\\nthe best places, and leave the people to make their things. Don\\'t let\\r\\nthem interfere. Down here they\\'ve got to choose for themselves. They\\r\\nwouldn\\'t care about taking advice here, but in London they\\'d probably\\r\\nbe content to leave it. Take them up to town for a fortnight. Stay\\r\\nat one of the best hotels, the Berkeley or the Carlton, and let them see\\r\\nplenty of nice people. And don\\'t be discouraged, uncle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where the devil did you get your common-sense from?\" he inquired,\\r\\nfiercely. \"Your mother hadn\\'t got it, and I\\'ll swear your father\\r\\nhadn\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Above all, be firm with them, uncle,\" she said. \"Put your foot down,\\r\\nand stick to it. They\\'ll obey you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Obey me? Good Lord, I\\'ll make \\'em,\" Mr. Bullsom declared,\\r\\nvigorously. \"Mary, you\\'re a brick. I feel quite cheerful. And,\\r\\nremember this, my girl. I shall make you an allowance, but that\\'s\\r\\nnothing. Come to me when you want a bit extra, and if ever the young\\r\\nman turns up, then I\\'ve got a word or two to say. Mind, I shall only be\\r\\ngiving you your own. My will\\'s signed and sealed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe kissed him fondly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re a good sort, uncle,\" she said. \"And now will you tell me what\\r\\nyou think of this letter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Read it to me, dear,\" he said. \"My eyes aren\\'t what they were.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe obeyed him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"41, BUCKLESBURY, LONDON, E. C.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR MADAM,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have received a communication from our agents at Montreal, asking us\\r\\nto ascertain the whereabouts of Miss Mary Scott, daughter of Richard\\r\\nScott, at one time a resident in that city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We believe that you are the young lady in question, and if you will do\\r\\nus the favour of calling at the above address, we may be able to give\\r\\nyou some information much to your advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are, dear madam,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yours respectfully,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"JONES AND LLOYD.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom stroked his chin thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sounds all right,\" he remarked. \"Of course you\\'ll go. But I always\\r\\nunderstood that your father\\'s relations were as poor as church mice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poorer, uncle! His father--my grandfather, that is--was a clergyman\\r\\nwith barely enough to live on, and his uncle was a Roman Catholic\\r\\npriest. Both of them have been dead for years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And your father--well, I know there was nothing there,\" Mr. Bullsom\\r\\nremarked, thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cabled out the money to bring me home,\" Mary reminded him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well!\" Mr. Bullsom declared. \"You must go and see these chaps.\\r\\nThere\\'s no harm in that, at any rate. We must all have that trip to\\r\\nLondon. I expect Brooks will be wanting to go and see Henslow. We\\'ll\\r\\nhave to give that chap what for, I know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina sailed into the room in a salmon-coloured wrapper, which should\\r\\nlong ago have been relegated to the bath-room. She pecked her father on\\r\\nthe cheek and nodded to Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you see Mr. Brooks, dear?\" her father remarked, with a twinkle\\r\\nin his eye and something very much like a wink to Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina screamed, and looked fearfully around the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, papa?\" she exclaimed. \"There is no one here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Serve you right if there had been,\" Mr. Bullsom declared, gruffly.\\r\\n\"A pretty state to come down in the morning at past nine o\\'clock.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina tossed her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am going to dress directly after breakfast,\" she remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then if you\\'ll allow me to say so,\" her father declared, \"before\\r\\nbreakfast is the time to dress, and not afterwards. You\\'re always the\\r\\nsame, Selina, underdressed when you think there\\'s no one around to see\\r\\nyou, and overdressed when there is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina poured herself out some coffee and yawned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La, papa, what do you know about it?\" she exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What my eyes tell me,\" Mr. Bullsom declared, sternly. \"You\\'ve no\\r\\nallowance to keep to. You\\'ve leave to spend what you want, and you\\'re\\r\\nnever fit to be seen. There\\'s Mary there taking thirty pounds a year\\r\\nfrom me, and won\\'t have a penny more, though she\\'s heartily welcome to\\r\\nit, and she looks a lady at any moment of the day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina drew herself up, and her eyes narrowed a little.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re talking about what, you don\\'t understand, pa,\" she answered with\\r\\ndignity. \"If you prefer Mary\\'s style of dress\"--she glanced with silent\\r\\ndisparagement at her cousin\\'s grey skirt and plain white blouse--\"well,\\r\\nit\\'s a matter of taste, isn\\'t it?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Taste!\" Mr. Bullsom replied, contemptuously. \"Taste! What sort of\\r\\ntaste do you call that beastly rug on your shoulders, eh? Or your hair\\r\\nrolled round and just a pin stuck through it? Looks as though it hadn\\'t\\r\\nbeen brushed for a week. Faugh! When your mother and I lived on two\\r\\npounds a week she never insulted me by coming down to breakfast in\\r\\nsuch a thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina eyed her father in angry astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thing indeed!\" she repeated. \"This wrapper cost me four guineas, and\\r\\ncame from Paris. That shows how much you know about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From Paris, did it?\" Mr. Bullsom retorted, fiercely. \"Then up-stairs\\r\\nyou go and take it off. You girls have had your own way too much, and\\r\\nI\\'m about tired of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall change it--after breakfast,\" Selina said, doubtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom threw open the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Up-stairs,\" he repeated, \"and throw it into the rag-bag.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina hesitated. Then she rose, and with scarlet cheeks and a poor\\r\\nshow of dignity, left the room. Mr. Bullsom drew himself up and beamed\\r\\nupon Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll show\\'em a bit,\" he declared, with great good-humour. \"I may be\\r\\nan ignorant old man, but I\\'m going to wake these girls up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary struggled for a moment, but her sense of humour triumphed. She\\r\\nburst out laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, uncle, uncle,\" she exclaimed, \"you\\'re a wonderful man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe beamed upon her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You come shopping with us in London,\" he said. \"We\\'ll have some fun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII\\r\\n\\r\\nFIFTEEN YEARS IN HELL\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really,\" Lady Caroom exclaimed, \"Enton is the cosiest large house I was\\r\\never in. Do throw that Bradshaw away, Arranmore. The one o\\'clock\\r\\ntrain will do quite nicely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore obeyed her literally. He jerked the volume lightly into\\r\\na far corner of the room and came over to her side. She was curled up\\r\\nin a huge easy-chair, and her face caught by the glow of the dancing\\r\\nfirelight almost startled him by its youth. There was not a single sign\\r\\nof middle age in the smooth cheeks, not a single grey hair, no sign of\\r\\nweariness in the soft full eyes raised to his.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe caught his glance and smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The firelight is so becoming!\" she murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t go!\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Arranmore. The Redcliffes would never forgive me, and we must\\r\\ngo some time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t see the necessity,\" he answered, slowly. \"You like Enton.\\r\\nMake it your home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe raised her eyebrows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How improper!\" \"Not necessarily,\" he answered. \"Take me too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat up in her chair and regarded him steadily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Am I to regard this,\" she asked, \"as an offer of marriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it sounds like it,\" he admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me. You might have given me a little more notice,\" she said.\\r\\n\"Let me think for a moment, please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps their thoughts travelled back in the same direction. He\\r\\nremembered his cousin and his playfellow, the fairest and daintiest girl\\r\\nhe had ever seen, his best friend, his constant companion. He\\r\\nremembered the days when she had first become something more to him, the\\r\\nmiseries of that time, his hopeless ineligibility--the separation. Then\\r\\nthe years of absence, the terrible branding years of his life, the\\r\\nhorrible pit, the time when night and day his only prayer had been the\\r\\nprayer for death. The self-repression of years seemed to grow weaker and\\r\\nweaker. He held out his hands. But she hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear,\" she said, \"you make me very happy. It is wonderful to think\\r\\nthis may come after all these years. But there is something which I\\r\\nwish to say to you first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very, very dear to me now--as you are--but you are not the man\\r\\nI loved years ago. You are a very different person indeed. Sometimes I\\r\\nam almost afraid of you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have no cause to be,\" he said. \"Indeed, you have no cause to be.\\r\\nSo far as you are concerned I have never changed. I am the same man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took one of his hands in hers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Philip,\" she said, \"you must not think hardly of me. You must not\\r\\nthink of me as simply afflicted with the usual woman\\'s curiosity. I am\\r\\nnot curious at all. I would rather not know. But remember that for\\r\\nnearly twenty years you passed out of my life. You have come back again\\r\\nwonderfully altered. You do not wish to keep the story of those years\\r\\nfor ever a sort of Bluebeards chamber in our lives?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I,\" he answered. \"I would have you do as I have done, rip them out\\r\\npage and chapter, annihilate them utterly. What have they to do with\\r\\nthe life before us? To you they would seem evil enough, to me they are\\r\\nthronged with horrible memories, with memories which, could I take them\\r\\nwith me, would poison heaven itself. So let us blot them out for ever.\\r\\nCome to me, Catherine, and help me to forget.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him with strained eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Philip,\" she said, \"I must understand you. I must understand what has\\r\\nmade you the man you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fifteen years in hell has done it,\" he answered, fiercely. \"Not even\\r\\nmy memory shall ever take me back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I marry you,\" she said, \"remember that I marry your past as well as\\r\\nyour future. And there are things--which need explanation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have been married.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a son.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe reeled as though he had been struck, and the silence between them was\\r\\nas the silence of tragedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see,\" she continued, \"I am bound to ask you to lift the curtain a\\r\\nlittle. Fate or instinct, or whatever you may like to call it, has led\\r\\nme a little way. I am not afraid to know. I have seen too much of life\\r\\nto be a hard judge. But you must hold out your hand and take me a\\r\\nlittle further.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe held him tightly. Her voice trembled a little. \"Dear, you\\r\\nmust. I am not an exacting woman, and I love you too well to be a\\r\\nhard judge of anything you might have to tell me. Ignorance is the only\\r\\nthing which I cannot bear. Remember how greatly you are changed, you\\r\\nare almost a stranger to me in some of your moods. I could not have\\r\\nyou wandering off into worlds of which I knew nothing. Sit down by my\\r\\nside and talk to me. I will ask no questions. You shall tell me your\\r\\nown way, and what you wish to leave out--leave it out. Come, is this so\\r\\nhard a task?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed frozen into inanition. His face was like the cast of a dead\\r\\nman\\'s. His voice was cold and hopeless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The key,\" he said, \"is gone. I shall never seek for it, I shall never\\r\\nfind it. I have known what madness is, and I am afraid. Shall we go\\r\\ninto the hall? I fancy that they are serving tea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him, half terrified, half amazed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean this as final?\" she said, deliberately. \"You refuse to offer\\r\\nany explanation, the explanation which common decency even would require\\r\\nof these things?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I expected too much,\" he answered. \"I know it very well. Forgive me,\\r\\nand let us forget.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rose to her feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know that you will ever regret this,\" she said. \"I pray that\\r\\nyou may.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Brooks she seemed the same charming woman as usual, as he heard her\\r\\nlight laugh come floating across the hall, and bowed over her white\\r\\nfingers. But Sybil saw the over-bright eyes and nervous mouth and had\\r\\nhard work to keep back the tears. She piled the cushions about a dark\\r\\ncorner of the divan, and chattered away recklessly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a night of sorrows,\" she exclaimed, pouring out the tea. \"Mr.\\r\\nBrooks and I were in the midst of a most affecting leave-taking--when\\r\\nthe tea came. Why do these mundane things always break in upon the most\\r\\nsacred moments?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Life,\" Lady Caroom said, helping herself recklessly to muffin, \"is\\r\\nsuch a wonderful mixture of the real and the fanciful, the actual and\\r\\nthe sentimental, one is always treading on the heels of the other. The\\r\\nlittle man who turns the handle must have lots of fun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If only he has a sense of humour,\" Brooks interposed. \"After all,\\r\\nthough, it is the grisly, ugly things which float to the top. One has\\r\\nto probe always for the beautiful, and it requires our rarest and most\\r\\ndifficult sense to apprehend the humorous.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore stirred his tea slowly. His face was like the face of a\\r\\ncarved image. Only Brooks seemed still unconscious of the shadow which\\r\\nwas stalking amongst them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We talk of life so glibly,\" he said. \"It is a pity that we cannot\\r\\nrealize its simplest elements. Life is purely subjective. Nothing\\r\\nexists except in our point of view. So we are continually making and\\r\\nmarring our own lives and the lives of other people by a word, an\\r\\naction, a thought.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me!\" Lady Caroom murmured. \"How-ever shall I be able to play\\r\\nbridge after tea if you all try to addle my brain by paradoxes and\\r\\nsubtle sayings beforehand! What does Arranmore mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put down his cup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not dare to understand me,\" he said. \"It is the most sincere\\r\\nunkindness when one talks only to answer. And as for bridge--remember\\r\\nthat this is a night of mourning. Bridge is far too frivolous a\\r\\npursuit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bridge a frivolous pursuit?\" Sybil exclaimed. \"Heavens, what\\r\\nsacrilege. What ought we to do, Lord Arranmore?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sit in sackcloth and ashes, and hear Brooks lecture on the poor,\" he\\r\\nanswered, lightly. \"Brooks is a mixture of the sentimentalist and the\\r\\nhideous pessimist, you know, and it is the privilege of his years to be\\r\\nsometimes in earnest. I know nothing more depressing than to listen to\\r\\na man who is in earnest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are getting positively light-headed,\" Sybil laughed. \"I can see no\\r\\npleasure in life save that which comes from an earnest pursuit of\\r\\nthings, good or evil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear child,\" Lord Arranmore answered, \"when you are a little older\\r\\nyou will know that to take life seriously is a sheer impossibility. You\\r\\nmay think that you are doing it, but you are not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There must be exceptions,\" Sybil declared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are none,\" Lord Arranmore answered, lightly, \"outside the\\r\\nmadhouse. For the realization of life comes only hand in hand with\\r\\ninsanity. The people who have come nearest to it carry the mark with\\r\\nthem all their life. For the fever of knowledge will scorch even those\\r\\nwho peer over the sides of the cauldron.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom helped herself to some more tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, Arranmore,\" she drawled, \"for sheer and unadulterated pessimism\\r\\nyou are unsurpassed. You must be a very morbid person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One is always called morbid,\" he remarked, \"who dares to look towards\\r\\nthe truth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are people,\" Lady Caroom answered, \"who look always towards the\\r\\nclouds, even when the sun is shining.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am in the minority,\" Lord Arranmore said, smiling. \"I feel myself\\r\\nbecoming isolated. Let us abandon the subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, let us convert you instead,\" Sybil declared. \"We want to look at\\r\\nthe sun, and we want to take you with us. You are really a very stupid\\r\\nperson, you know. Why do you want to stay all alone amongst the\\r\\nshadows?\" Arranmore smiled faintly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The sun shines,\" he said, \"only for those who have eyes to see it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Blindness is not incurable,\" she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Save when the light in the eyes is dead,\" he answered. \"Come, shall we\\r\\nplay a game at fourhanded billiards?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt resolved itself into a match between Lady Caroom and Lord Arranmore,\\r\\nwho were both players far above the average. Sybil and Brooks talked,\\r\\nbut for once her attention wandered. She seemed listening to the\\r\\nclick of the billiard-balls, and watching the man and the woman between\\r\\nwhom all conversation seemed dead. Brooks noticed her absorption, and\\r\\nabandoned his own attempts to interest her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your mother and Lord Arranmore,\" he remarked, \"are very old friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have known one another all their lives,\" she murmured. \"Lord\\r\\nArranmore has changed a good deal though since his younger days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks made no reply. The girl suddenly bent her head towards him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you a judge of character?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Scarcely. I have not had enough experience. It is a fascinating\\r\\nstudy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very. Now I want to ask you something. What do you think of Lord\\r\\nArranmore?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer tone betokened unusual seriousness. His light answer died away on\\r\\nhis lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very hard for me to answer that question,\" he said. \"Lord\\r\\nArranmore has been most unnecessarily kind to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His character?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not pretend to be able to understand it. I think that he is often\\r\\nwilfully misleading. He does not wish to be understood. He delights in\\r\\nparadoxy and moral gymnastics.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He may blind your judgment. How do you personally feel towards him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That,\" he answered, \"might be misleading. He has shown me so much\\r\\nkindness. Yet I think--I am sure--that I liked him from the first\\r\\nmoment I saw him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I like him too. I cannot help it. Yet one can be with him, can live\\r\\nin the same house for weeks, even months, and remain an utter stranger\\r\\nto him. He has self-repression which is marvellous--never at\\r\\nfault--never a joint loose. One wonders so much what lies beyond. One\\r\\nwould like to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it wise?\" he asked. \"After all, is it our concern?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not ours. But if you were a woman would you be content to take him on\\r\\ntrust?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would depend upon my own feelings,\" he answered, hesitatingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whether you cared for him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe beat the floor with her foot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are wrong,\" she said, \"I am sure that you are wrong. To care for\\r\\none is to wish ever to believe the best of them. It is better to keep\\r\\napart for ever than to run any risks. Supposing that unknown past was\\r\\nof evil, and one discovered it. To care for him would only make the\\r\\nsuffering keener.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may be so,\" he admitted. \"May I ask you something?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You speak--of yourself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eyes met his, and he looked hastily downwards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Absurd,\" she murmured, and inclined her head towards the\\r\\nbilliard-table. \"They have been--attached to one another always. Come\\r\\nover here to the window, and I will tell you something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked towards the great circular window which overlooked the\\r\\ndrive. As they stood there together a four-wheeled cab drove slowly by,\\r\\nand a girl leaned forward and looked at them. Brooks started as he\\r\\nrecognized her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, that must be some one for me,\" he exclaimed, in a puzzled tone.\\r\\n\"Whatever can have happened to old Bullsom?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him politely bewildered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is the niece of a man whom I know very well in Medchester,\" he\\r\\nexclaimed. \"Something must have happened to her uncle. It is most\\r\\nextraordinary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nMARY SCOTT PAYS AN UNEXPECTED CALL\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks met the butler entering the room with a card upon his salver. He\\r\\nstretched out his hand for it mechanically, but the man only regarded\\r\\nhim in mild surprise. \"For his lordship, sir. Excuse me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man passed on. Brooks remained bewildered. Lord Arranmore took the\\r\\ncard from the tray and examined it leisurely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Mary Scott,\" he repeated aloud. \"Are you sure that the young lady\\r\\nasked to see me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite sure, your lordship,\" the servant answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Scott. The name sounds familiar, somehow!\" Lord Arranmore said.\\r\\n\"Haven\\'t I heard you mention it, Brooks?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Scott is the niece of Mr. Bullsom, one of my best clients, a\\r\\nlarge builder in Medchester,\" Brooks answered. \"Why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped suddenly short. Arranmore glanced towards him in polite\\r\\nunconcern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You saw her with me at Mellon\\'s, in Medchester. You asked me her\\r\\nname.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore bent the card in his forefinger, and dropped his\\r\\neyeglass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So that is the young lady,\" he remarked. \"I remember her distinctly.\\r\\nBut I do not understand what she can want within me. Is she by any\\r\\nchance, Brooks, one of those young persons who go about with a\\r\\ncollecting-card--who want money for missions and that sort of thing? If\\r\\nso, I am afraid she has wasted her cab fare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is not in the least that sort of person,\" Brooks answered,\\r\\nemphatically. \"I have no idea what she wants to see you about, but I\\r\\nam convinced that her visit has a legitimate object.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore stuck the card in his waistcoat pocket and shrugged his\\r\\nshoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are my man of affairs, Brooks. I commission you to see her. Find\\r\\nout her business if you can, and don\\'t let me be bothered unless it is\\r\\nnecessary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not sure that I care to interfere--that my presence might not be\\r\\nlikely to cause her embarrassment,\" he said. \"I have seen her lately,\\r\\nand she made no mention of this visit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore glanced at him as though surprised. \"I should like you\\r\\nto see her,\" he said, suavely. \"It seems to me preferable to asking\\r\\nher to state her business to a servant. If you have any objection to\\r\\ndoing so she must be sent back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks turned unwillingly away. As he had expected, Mary sprang to her\\r\\nfeet upon his entrance into the room, and the colour streamed into\\r\\nher cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You here!\" she exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook hands with her, and tried to behave as though he thought her\\r\\npresence the most natural thing in the world. \"Yes. You see I am Lord\\r\\nArranmore\\'s man of affairs now, and he keeps me pretty hard at work. He\\r\\nseems to have a constitutional objection to doing anything for himself.\\r\\nHe has even sent me to--to--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understand,\" she interrupted. \"To ascertain my business. Well, I\\r\\ncan\\'t tell it even to you. It is Lord Arranmore whom I want to see. No\\r\\none else will do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks leaned against the table and looked at her with a puzzled smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see, it\\'s a little awkward, isn\\'t it?\" he declared. \"Lord\\r\\nArranmore is very eccentric, and especially so upon this point. He will\\r\\nnot see strangers. Write him a line or two and let me take it to\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe considered for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well. Give me a piece of paper and an envelope.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wrote a single line only. Brooks took it back into the great inner\\r\\nhall, where Lord Arranmore had started another game of billiards with\\r\\nLady Caroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Scott assured me that her business with you is private,\" he\\r\\nannounced. \"She has written this note.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore laid his cue deliberately aside and broke the seal. It\\r\\nwas evident that the contents of the note consisted of a few words only,\\r\\nyet after once perusing them he moved a little closer to the light and\\r\\nre-read them slowly. Then with a little sigh he folded the note in the\\r\\nsmallest possible compass and thrust it into his waistcoat pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your young friend, my dear Brooks,\" he said, taking up his cue, \"does\\r\\nme the honour to mistake me for some one else. Will you inform her that\\r\\nI have no knowledge of the person to whom she alludes, and suggest--as\\r\\ndelicately as you choose--that as she is mistaken an interview is\\r\\nunnecessary. It is, I believe, my turn, Catherine.\" \"You decline,\\r\\nthen, to see her?\" Brooks said.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore turned upon him with a rare irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have I not made myself clear, Brooks?\" he said. \"If I were to keep\\r\\nopen house to all the young women who choose to claim acquaintance with\\r\\nme I should scarcely have a moment to call my own, or a house fit to ask\\r\\nmy friends to visit. Be so good as to make my answer sufficiently\\r\\nexplicit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is unnecessary, Lord Arranmore. I have come to ask you for it\\r\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all turned round. Mary Scott was coming slowly towards them across\\r\\nthe thick rugs, into which her feet sunk noiselessly. Her face was very\\r\\npale, and her large eyes were full of nervous apprehension. But about\\r\\nher mouth were certain rigid lines which spoke of determination.\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil leaned forward from her chair, and Lady Caroom watched her\\r\\napproach with lifted eyebrows and a stare of well-bred and languid\\r\\ninsolence. Lord Arranmore laid down his cue and rose at once to meet\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are Lord Arranmore,\" she said, looking at him fixedly. \"Will you\\r\\nplease answer the question--in my note?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bowed a little coldly, but he made no remark as to her intrusion. \"I\\r\\nhave already,\" he said, \"given my answer to Mr. Brooks. The name\\r\\nwhich you mention is altogether unknown to me, nor have I ever visited\\r\\nthe place you speak of. You have apparently been misled by a chance\\r\\nlikeness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a very wonderful one,\" she said, slowly, keeping her eyes fixed\\r\\nupon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I regret,\" he said, \"that you should have had your journey for nothing.\\r\\nI can, I presume, be of no further use to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not regret my journey here,\" she answered. \"I could not rest\\r\\nuntil I had seen you closely, face to face, and asked you that question.\\r\\nYou deny then that you were ever called Philip Ferringshaw?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most assuredly,\" he answered, curtly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very strange,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strange?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. It is very strange because I am perfectly certain that you were.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took up his cue and commenced chalking it in a leisurely manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear young lady,\" he said, \"you are; I understand, a friend of Mr.\\r\\nBrooks, and are therefore entitled to some amount of consideration from\\r\\nme. But I must respectfully remind you that your presence here is, to\\r\\nput it mildly, unsought, and that I do not find it pleasant to be called\\r\\na liar under my own roof and before my friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pleasant!\" she eyed him scornfully; \"nor did my father find it pleasant\\r\\nto be ruined and murdered by you, a debauched gambler, a common\\r\\nswindler.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore, unruffled, permitted himself to smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me,\" he said, \"this is getting positively melodramatic. Brooks,\\r\\nfor her own sake, let me beg of you to induce the young woman to leave\\r\\nus. In her calmer moments she will, I am sure, repent of these\\r\\nunwarranted statements to a perfect stranger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks was numbed--for the moment speechless. Sybil had risen to her\\r\\nfeet as though with the intention of leaving the room. But Lord\\r\\nArranmore interposed. If he were acting it was marvellously done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg,\" he said, \"that you will none of you desert me. These\\r\\naccusations of--Miss Scott, I believe are unnerving. A murderer, a\\r\\nswindler and a rogue are hard names, young lady. May I ask if your\\r\\nstring of invectives is exhausted, or is there any further abuse which\\r\\nyou feel inclined to heap upon me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl never flinched.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have called you nothing,\" she said, \"which you do not deserve. Do\\r\\nyou still deny that you were in Canada--in Montreal--sixteen years ago?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most assuredly I do deny it,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks started, and turned suddenly towards Lord Arranmore as though\\r\\ndoubtful whether he had heard rightly. This was a year before his\\r\\nfather\\'s death. The girl was unmoved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see that I should come here with proofs,\" she exclaimed. \"Well, they\\r\\nare easy enough to collect. You shall have them. But before I go, Lord\\r\\nArranmore, let me ask you if you know who I am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understand,\" Lord Arranmore answered, \"that you are the daughter or\\r\\nniece of a highly respectable tradesman in Medchester, who is a client\\r\\nof our young friend here, Mr. Brooks. Let me tell you, young lady,\\r\\nthat but for that fact I should not--tolerate your presence here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Mr. Bullsom\\'s niece,\" the girl answered, \"but I am the daughter\\r\\nof Martin Scott Cartnell!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed to Brooks that a smothered exclamation of some sort broke\\r\\nfrom Lord Arranmore\\'s tightly compressed lips, but his face was so\\r\\ncompletely in the shadow that its expression was lost. But he himself\\r\\nnow revealed it, for touching a knob in the wall a shower of electric\\r\\nlamps suddenly glowed around the room. He leaned forward and looked\\r\\nintently into the face of the girl who had become his accuser. She met\\r\\nhis gaze coldly, without flinching, the pallor of her cheeks relieved by\\r\\na single spot of burning colour, her eyes bright with purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is incredible,\" he said, softly, \"but it is true. You are the\\r\\nuntidy little thing with a pigtail who used always to be playing games\\r\\nwith the boys when you ought to have been at school. Come, I am glad to\\r\\nsee you. Why do you come to me like a Cassandra of the Family Herald?\\r\\nYour father was my companion for a while, but we were never intimate. I\\r\\ncertainly neither robbed nor murdered him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You did both,\" she answered, fiercely. \"You were his evil genius from\\r\\nthe first. It was through you he took to drink, through you he became a\\r\\ngambler. You encouraged him to play for stakes larger than he could\\r\\nafford. You won money from him which you knew was not his to lose. He\\r\\ncame to you for help. You laughed at him. That night he shot himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was,\" Lord Arranmore remarked, \"a very foolish thing to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who or what you were before you came to Montreal I do not know,\" she\\r\\ncontinued, \"but there you brought misery and ruin upon every one\\r\\nconnected with you. I was a child in those days, but I remember how you\\r\\nwere hated. You broke the heart of Durran Lapage, an honest man whom\\r\\nyou called your friend, and you left his wife to starve in a common\\r\\nlodging house. There was never a man or woman who showed you kindness\\r\\nthat did not live to regret it. You may be the Marquis of Arranmore\\r\\nnow, but you have left a life behind the memory of which should be a\\r\\nconstant torture to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you finished, young lady?\" he asked, coldly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I have finished,\" she answered. \"I pray Heaven that the next time\\r\\nwe meet may be in the police-court. The police of Montreal are still\\r\\nlooking for Philip Ferringshaw, and they will find in me a very ready\\r\\nwitness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, this is a most unpleasant young person,\" Lord Arranmore\\r\\nsaid. \"Brooks, do see her off the premises before she changes her mind\\r\\nand comes for me again. You have, I hope, been entertained, ladies,\" he\\r\\nadded, turning to Sybil and Lady Caroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe eyed them carelessly enough to all appearance, yet with an inward\\r\\nsearchingness which seemed to find what it feared. He turned to Brooks,\\r\\nbut he and Mary Scott had left the room together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The girl-was terribly in earnest,\" Lady Caroom said, with averted eyes.\\r\\n\"Were you not--a little cruel to her, Arranmore? Not that I believe\\r\\nthese horrid things, of course. But she did. She was honest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore shrugged his shoulders. He was looking out of the\\r\\nwindow, out into the grey windy darkness, listening to the raindrops\\r\\nsplashing against the window-pane, wondering how long Brooks would be,\\r\\nand if in his face too he should see the shadow, and it seemed to him\\r\\nthat Brooks lingered a very long time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall we finish our game of billiards, Catherine?\" he asked, turning\\r\\ntowards her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well--I think not,\" she answered. \"I am a little tired, and it is\\r\\nalmost time the dressing bell rang. I think Sybil and I will go\\r\\nup-stairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey passed away--he made no effort to detain them. He lit a cigarette,\\r\\nand paced the room impatiently. At last he rang the bell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is Mr. Brooks?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Brooks has only just returned, my lord,\" the man answered. \"He\\r\\nwent some distance with the young lady. He has gone direct to his\\r\\nroom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore nodded. He threw himself into his easy-chair, and his\\r\\nhead sank upon his hand. He looked steadfastly into the heart of the\\r\\nred coals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIX\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MARQUIS MEPHISTOPHELES\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am so sorry,\" she said, softly, \"our last evening is spoilt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head with an effort at gaiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us conspire,\" he said. \"You and I at least will make a struggle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid,\" she said, \"that it would be hopeless. Mother is an\\r\\nabsolute wreck, and I saw Lord Arranmore go into the library just now\\r\\nwith that terrible white look under his eyes. I saw it once before.\\r\\nUgh!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After all,\" he said, \"it only means that we shall be honest.\\r\\nCheerfulness to-night could only be forced.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed softly into his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How correct!\" she murmured. \"You are improving fast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned and looked at her, slim and graceful in her white muslin gown,\\r\\nher fair hair brushed back from her forehead with a slight wave, but\\r\\ndrooping low over her ears, a delicate setting for her piquant face.\\r\\nThe dark brown eyes, narrowing a little towards the lids, met his with\\r\\nfrank kindliness, her mouth quivered a little as though with the desire\\r\\nto break away into a laugh. The slight duskiness of her cheeks--she had\\r\\nlived for three years in Italy and never worn a veil--pleased him better\\r\\nthan the insipidity of pink and white, and the absence of jewelry--she\\r\\nwore neither bracelet nor rings gave her an added touch of distinction,\\r\\nwhich restless youth finds something so much harder to wear than sedate\\r\\nmiddle age. The admiration grew in his eyes. She was charming.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lips broke away at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After all,\" she murmured, \"I think that I shall enjoy myself this\\r\\nevening. You are looking all sorts of nice things at me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My eyes,\" he answered, \"are more daring than my lips.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you call yourself a lawyer?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that a challenge? Well, I was thinking that you looked charming.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that all? I have a looking-glass, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I shall miss you--very much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe suddenly avoided his eyes, but it was for a second only. Yet Brooks\\r\\nwas himself conscious of the significance of that second. He set his\\r\\nteeth hard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The days here,\" he said, slowly, \"have been very pleasant. It has all\\r\\nbeen--such a different life for me. A few months ago I knew no one\\r\\nexcept a few of the Medchester people, and was working hard to make a\\r\\nmodest living. Sometimes I feel here as though I were a modern Aladdin.\\r\\nThere is a sense of unreality about Lord Arranmore\\'s extraordinary\\r\\nkindness to me. To-night, more than ever, I cannot help feeling that it\\r\\nis something like a dream which may pass away at any moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Arranmore is not an impulsive person,\" she said. \"He must have\\r\\nhad some reason for being so decent to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, as regards the management of his affairs perhaps,\" Brooks\\r\\nanswered. \"But why he should ask me here, and treat me as though I were\\r\\nhis social equal and all that sort of thing--well, you know that is a\\r\\npuzzle, isn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know,\" she answered. \"Lord Arranmore is not exactly the\\r\\nman to be a slave to, or even to respect, the conventional, and your\\r\\nbeing--what you are, naturally makes you a pleasant companion to\\r\\nhim--and his guests. No, I don\\'t think that it is strange.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very flattering,\" he said, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not in the least,\" she assured him. \"Now-a-days birth seems to be\\r\\nrather a handicap than otherwise to the making of the right sort of\\r\\npeople. I am sure there are more impossibilities in the peerage than in\\r\\nthe nouveaux riches. I know heaps of people who because their names are\\r\\nin Debrett seem to think that manners are unnecessary, and that they\\r\\nhave a sort of God-sent title to gentility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" he said, \"you are more than half a Radical.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is your influence,\" she said, demurely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will soon pass away,\" he sighed. \"To-morrow you will be back again\\r\\namongst your friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why do one\\'s friends bore one so much more than other people\\'s?\" she\\r\\nexclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When one thinks of it,\" he remarked, \"you must have been very bored\\r\\nhere. Why, for the last fortnight there have been no other visitors in\\r\\nthe house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There have been compensations,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me about them!\" he begged.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed up at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I were to say the occasional visits of Mr. Kingston Brooks, would\\r\\nyou be conceited?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be like putting my vanity in a hothouse,\" he answered, \"but I\\r\\nwould try and bear it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I will say it, then!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned and looked at her with a sudden seriousness. Some\\r\\nconsciousness of the change in his mood seemed to be at once\\r\\ncommunicated to her. Her eyes no longer met his. She moved a little on\\r\\none side and took up an ornament from an ormolu table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish that you meant it,\" he murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do!\" she whispered, almost under her breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks suddenly forgot many things, but Nemesis intervened. There was\\r\\nthe sound of much rustling of silken skirts, and--Lady Caroom\\'s poodle,\\r\\nfollowed by herself, came round the angle of the drawing-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Sybil,\" she exclaimed, \"do come and tie Balfour\\'s ribbon for\\r\\nme. Marie has no idea of making a bow spread itself out, and pink is\\r\\nso becoming to him. Thanks, dear. Where is our host? I thought that I\\r\\nwas late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore entered as she spoke. His evening dress, as usual, was\\r\\nof the most severely simple type. To-night its sombreness was\\r\\nimpressive. With such a background his pallor seemed almost waxen-like.\\r\\nHe offered his arm to Lady Caroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was not sure,\" he said, with a lightness which seemed natural enough,\\r\\n\"whether to-night I might not have to dine alone whilst you poor people\\r\\nsat and played havoc with the shreds of my reputation. Groves, the\\r\\ncabinet Johannesburg and the \\'84 Heidsieck--though I am afraid,\" he\\r\\nadded, looking down at his companion, \"that not all the wine in my\\r\\ncellar could make this feast of farewells a cheerful one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Farewell celebrations of all sorts are such a mistake,\" Lady Caroom\\r\\nmurmured. \"We have been so happy here too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You brought the happiness with you,\" Lord Arranmore said, \"and you take\\r\\nit away with you. Enton will be a very dull place when you are gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your own stay here is nearly up, is it not?\" Lady Caroom asked. \"Very\\r\\nnearly. I expect to go to Paris next week--at latest the week after, in\\r\\ntime at any rate for Bernhardt\\'s new play. So I suppose we shall soon\\r\\nall be scattered over the face of the earth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Except me,\" Brooks interposed, ruefully. \"I shall be the one who will\\r\\ndo the vegetating.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom laughed softly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Foolish person! You will be within two hours of London. You none of\\r\\nyou have the slightest idea as to the sort of place we are going to. We\\r\\nare a day\\'s journey from anywhere. The morning papers are twenty-four\\r\\nhours late. The men drink port wine, and the women sit round the fire\\r\\nin the drawing-room after dinner and wait--and wait--and wait. Oh, that\\r\\nawful waiting. I know it so well. And it isn\\'t much better when the\\r\\nmen do come. They play whist instead of bridge, and a woman in the\\r\\nbilliard-room is a lost soul. Our hostess always hides my cue directly\\r\\nI arrive, and pretends that it has been lost. By the bye, what a dear\\r\\nlittle room this is, Arranmore. We haven\\'t dined here before, have we?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore shook his head. He held up his wineglass thoughtfully as\\r\\nthough criticizing the clearness of the amber fluid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\" he said. \"I ordered dinner to be served in here because over our\\r\\ndessert I propose to offer you a novel form of entertainment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How wonderful,\" Sybil said. \"Will it be very engrossing? Will it help\\r\\nus to forget?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That depends,\" he said, \"how anxious you are to forget.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked hastily away. For a moment Brooks met her eyes, and his\\r\\nheart gave an unusual leap. Lady Caroom watched them both thoughtfully,\\r\\nand then turned to their host.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have excited our curiosity, Arranmore. You surely don\\'t propose to\\r\\nkeep us on tenterhooks all through dinner?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will give a fillip to your appetite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My appetite needs no fillip. It is disgraceful to try and make me eat\\r\\nmore than I do already. I am getting hideously stout. I found my maid\\r\\nin tears to-night because I positively could not get into my most\\r\\nbecoming bodice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you possess a more becoming one than this,\" Lord Arranmore said,\\r\\nwith a bow, \"it is well for our peace of mind that you cannot wear it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a very pretty subterfuge, but a subterfuge it remains,\" Lady\\r\\nCaroom answered. \"Now be candid. I love candour. What are you going\\r\\nto do to amuse us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not spoil my effect. The slightest hint would make everything seem\\r\\ntame. Brooks, I insist upon it that you try my Johannesburg. It was\\r\\ngiven to my grandfather by the Grand Duke of Shleistein. Groves!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks submitted willingly enough, for the wine was wonderful. Sybil\\r\\nleaned over so that their heads almost touched.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look at our host,\" she whispered. \"What does he remind you of?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks glanced across the table, brilliant with its burden of old\\r\\nsilver, of cut-glass and hothouse flowers. Lord Arranmore\\'s face,\\r\\nnotwithstanding his ready flow of conversation, seemed unusually still\\r\\nand white--the skin drawn across the bones, even the lips pallid. The\\r\\nsombreness of his costume, the glitter in his eyes, the icy coldness of\\r\\nhis lack of coloring, though time after time he set down his wineglass\\r\\nempty, were curiously impressive. Brooks looked back into her face, his\\r\\neyes full of question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mephistopheles,\" she whispered. \"He is absolutely weird to-night. If\\r\\nhe sat and looked at me and we were alone I should shriek.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore lifted a glass of champagne to the level of his head and\\r\\nlooked thoughtfully around the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" he said, \"a toast-to ourselves. Singly? Collectively. Lady\\r\\nCaroom, I drink to the delightful memories with which you have peopled\\r\\nEnton. Sybil, may you charm society as your mother has done. Brooks,\\r\\nyour very good health. May your entertainment this evening be a welcome\\r\\none.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will drink to all those things,\" Lady Caroom declared, \"with\\r\\nenthusiasm. But I am afraid your good wishes for Sybil are beyond any\\r\\nhope of realization. She is far too honest to flourish in society. She\\r\\nwill probably marry a Bishop or a Cabinet Minister, and become engrossed\\r\\nin theology or politics. You know how limiting that sort of thing is.\\r\\nI am in deadly fear that she may become humdrum. A woman who really\\r\\nstudies or knows anything about anything can never be a really\\r\\nbrilliant woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I pass for being intelligent because I parade my ignorance so, just\\r\\nas Sophie Mills is considered a paragon of morality because she is\\r\\nalways talking about running off with one of the boys in her husband\\'s\\r\\nregiment. It is a gigantic bluff, you know, but it comes off. Most\\r\\nbluffs do come off if one is only daring enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must tell them that up at Redcliffe,\" Lord Arranmore remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil laughed heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Redcliffe is the one place where mother is dumb,\" she declared. \"Up\\r\\nthere they look upon her as a stupid but well-meaning person. She is\\r\\nabsolutely afraid to open her mouth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are so absurdly literal,\" Lady Caroom sighed, helping herself to\\r\\nan infinitesimal portion of a wonderful savoury. \"Don\\'t talk about the\\r\\nplace. I know I shall have an attack of nerves there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mother always gets nerves if she mayn\\'t talk,\" Sybil murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re an undutiful daughter,\" Lady Caroom declared. \"If I do talk I\\r\\nnever say anything, so nobody need listen unless they like. About this\\r\\nentertainment, Arranmore. Are you going to make the wineglass\\r\\ndisappear and the apples fly about the room a la Maskelyne and Cook? I\\r\\nhope our share in it consists in sitting down.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore turned to the butler behind his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have coffee and liqueur served here, Groves, and bring some cigarettes.\\r\\nThen you can send the servants away and leave us alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good, your lordship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore looked around at his guests.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The entertainment,\" he said, \"will incur no greater hardship upon you\\r\\nthan a little patience. I am going to tell you a story.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XX\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CONFIDENCE OF LORD ARRANMORE\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servants had left the room, and the doors were fast closed. Lord\\r\\nArranmore sat a little forward in his high-backed chair, one hand\\r\\ngrasping the arm, the other stretched flat upon the table before him.\\r\\nBy his side, neglected, was a cedar-wood box of his favourite\\r\\ncigarettes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am going,\" he said, thoughtfully, \"to tell you a story, of whom the\\r\\nhero is--myself. A poor sort of entertainment perhaps, but then there\\r\\nis a little tragedy and a little comedy in what I have to tell. And you\\r\\nthree are the three people in the world to whom certain things were\\r\\nbetter told.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey bent forward, fascinated by the cold directness of his speech, by\\r\\nthe suggestion of strange things to come. The mask of their late gaiety\\r\\nhad fallen away. Lady Caroom, grave and sad-eyed, was listening with an\\r\\nanxiety wholly unconcealed. Under the shaded lamplight their faces,\\r\\ndominated by that cold masterly figure at the head of the table, were\\r\\nalmost Rembrandtesque.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have heard a string of incoherent but sufficiently damaging\\r\\naccusations made against me to-day by a young lady whose very existence,\\r\\nI may say, was a surprise to me. It suited me then to deny them.\\r\\nNevertheless they were in the main true.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe announcement was no shock. Every one of the three curiously enough\\r\\nhad believed the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go a little further back than the time of which she spoke. At\\r\\ntwenty-six years old I was an idle young man of good family, but scant\\r\\nexpectations, supposed to be studying at the Bar, but in reality idling\\r\\nmy time about town. In those days, Lady Caroom, you had some knowledge\\r\\nof me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Up to the time of your disappearance--yes. I remember, Arranmore,\" she\\r\\ncontinued, her manner losing for a moment some of its restraint, and\\r\\nher eyes and tone suddenly softening, \"dancing with you that evening.\\r\\nWe arranged to meet at Ranelagh the next day, and, when the next day\\r\\ncame, you had vanished, gone as completely as though the earth had\\r\\nswallowed you up. For weeks every one was asking what has become of\\r\\nhim. And then--I suppose you were forgotten.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This,\" Lord Arranmore continued, \"is the hardest part of my narrative,\\r\\nthe hardest because the most difficult to make you understand. You will\\r\\nforgive my offering you the bare facts only. I will remind you that I\\r\\nwas young, impressionable, and had views. So to continue!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manner of his speech was in its way chillingly impressive. He was\\r\\nstill sitting in exactly the same position, one hand upon the arm of his\\r\\nhigh-backed chair, the other upon the table before him. He made use of\\r\\nno gestures, his face remained as white and emotionless as a carved\\r\\nimage, his tone, though clear and low, was absolutely monotonous. But\\r\\nthere was about him a subtle sense of repression apparent to all of\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On my way home that night my hansom knocked down an old man. He was\\r\\nnot seriously hurt, and I drove him home. On the way he stared at me\\r\\ncuriously. Every now and then he laughed--unpleasantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I have never seen any one out of your world before,\\' he said. \\'I\\r\\ndare say you have never spoken to any one out of mine except to toss us\\r\\nalms. Come and see where I live.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He insisted, and I went. I found myself in a lodging-house, now pulled\\r\\ndown and replaced by one of Lord Rowton\\'s tenement houses. I saw a\\r\\nhundred human beings more or less huddled together promiscuously, and\\r\\nthe face of every one of them was like the face of a rat. The old man\\r\\ndragged me from room to room, laughing all the time. He showed me\\r\\nchildren herded together without distinction of sex or clothing, here\\r\\nand there he pointed to a face where some apprehension of the light was\\r\\nfighting a losing battle with the ghouls of disease, of vice, of foul\\r\\nair, of filth. I was faint and giddy when we had looked over that one\\r\\nhouse, but the old man was not satisfied. He dragged me on to the roof\\r\\nand pointed eastwards. There, as far as the eyes could reach, was a\\r\\nblackened wilderness of smoke-begrimed dwellings. He looked at me and\\r\\ngrinned. I can see him now. He had only one tooth, a blackened yellow\\r\\nstump, and every time he opened his mouth to laugh he was nearly choked\\r\\nwith coughing. He leaned out over the palisading and reached with both\\r\\nhis arms eastward. \\'There,\\' he cried, frantically, \\'you have seen one.\\r\\nThere are thousands and tens of thousands of houses like this, a million\\r\\ncrawling vermin who were born into the world in your likeness, as you\\r\\nwere born, my fine gentleman. Day by day they wake in their holes, fill\\r\\ntheir lungs with foul air, their stomachs with rotten food, break their\\r\\nbacks and their hearts over some hideous task. Every day they drop a\\r\\nlittle lower down. Drink alone keeps them alive, stirs their blood now\\r\\nand then so that they can feel their pulses beat, brings them a blessed\\r\\nstupor. And see over there the sun, God\\'s sun, rises every morning,\\r\\nover them and you. Young man! You see those flaming spots of light?\\r\\nThey are gin-palaces. You may thank your God for them, for they alone\\r\\nkeep this horde of rotten humanity from sweeping westwards, breaking up\\r\\nyour fine houses, emptying your wine into the street, tearing the silk\\r\\nand laces from your beautiful soft-limbed women. Bah! But you have\\r\\nread. It would be the French Revolution over again. Oh, but you are\\r\\nwise, you in the West, your statesmen and your philanthropists, that you\\r\\nbuild these gin-palaces, and smile, and rub your hands and build more\\r\\nand spend the money gaily. You build the one dam which can keep back\\r\\nyour retribution. You keep them stupefied, you cheapen the vile liquor\\r\\nand hold it to their noses. So they drink, and you live. But a day of\\r\\nlight may come.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore ceased speaking, stretched out his hand and helped\\r\\nhimself to wine with unfaltering fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have tried,\" he continued, \"to repeat the exact words which the old\\r\\nman used to me, and I do not find it so difficult as you might imagine,\\r\\nbecause at that time they made a great impression upon me. But I\\r\\ncannot, of course, hope to reproduce to you his terrible earnestness,\\r\\nthe burning passion with which every word seemed to spring from his\\r\\nlips. Their effect upon me at that time you will be able to judge when\\r\\nI tell you this--that I never returned to my rooms, that for ten years I\\r\\nnever set foot west of Temple Bar. I first joined a small society in\\r\\nWhitechapel, then I worked for myself, and finally I became a\\r\\npolice-court missionary at Southwark Police-Court. The history of\\r\\nthose years is the history of a slowly-growing madness. I commenced\\r\\nby trying to improve whole districts-I ended with the individual.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks\\' wineglass fell with a little crash upon the tablecloth. The\\r\\nwine, a long silky stream, flowed away from him unstaunched, unregarded.\\r\\nHis eyes were fixed upon Lord Arranmore. He leaned forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A police-court missionary!\" he cried, hoarsely.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore regarded him for a moment in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. As you doubtless surmise, I am your father. Afterwards you may\\r\\nask me questions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks sat as one stupefied, and then a sudden warm touch upon his hand\\r\\nsent the blood coursing once more through his veins. Sybil\\'s fingers\\r\\nlay for a moment upon his. She smiled kindly at him. Lord Arranmore\\'s\\r\\nvoice once more broke the short silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The individual was my greatest disappointment,\" he continued. \"Young\\r\\nand old, all were the same. I took them to live with me, I sent them\\r\\nabroad, I found them situations in this country, I talked with them,\\r\\nread with them, showed them the simplest means within their reach by\\r\\nmeans of which they might take into their lives a certain measure of\\r\\nbeautiful things. Failure would only make me more dogged, more eager.\\r\\nI would spend months sometimes with one man or boy, and at last I\\r\\nwould assure myself of success. I would find them a situation, see them\\r\\nperhaps once a week, then less often, and the end was always the same.\\r\\nThey fell back. I had put the poison to sleep, but it was always there.\\r\\nIt was their everlasting heritage, a gift from father to son, bred in\\r\\nthe bone, a part of their blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In those days I married a lady devoted to charitable works. Our\\r\\npurpose was to work together, but we found it impracticable. There was,\\r\\nI fear, little sympathy between us. The only bond was our work--and\\r\\nthat was soon to be broken. For there came a time, after ten breathless\\r\\nyears, when I paused to consider.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe raised his glass to his lips and drained it. The wine was powerful,\\r\\nbut it brought no tinge of colour to his cheeks, nor any lustre to his\\r\\neyes. He continued in the same firm, expressionless tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There came a night when I found myself thinking, and I knew then that a\\r\\nnew terror was stealing into my life. I made my way up to the roof of\\r\\nthe house where that old man had first taken me, and I leaned once more\\r\\nover the palisading and looked eastwards. I fancied that I could still\\r\\nhear the echoes of his frenzied words, and for the first time I heard\\r\\nthe note of mockery ringing clearly through them. There they\\r\\nstretched--the same blackened wilderness of roofs sheltering the same\\r\\nhorde of drinking, filthy, cursing, parasitical creatures; there flared\\r\\nthe gin-palaces, more of them, more brilliantly lit, more gorgeously\\r\\ndecorated. Ten years of my life, and what had I done? What could any\\r\\none do? The truth seemed suddenly written across the sky in letters of\\r\\nfire. I, a poor human creature, had been fighting with a few other\\r\\nfanatics against the inviolable, the unconquerable laws of nature. The\\r\\nhideous mistake of all individual effort was suddenly revealed to me.\\r\\n\\'We were like a handful of children striving to dam a mighty torrent\\r\\nwith a few handfuls of clay. Better a thousand times that these people\\r\\nrotted--and died in their holes, that disease should stalk through their\\r\\nstreets, and all the evil passions born of their misery and filth should\\r\\nbe allowed to blaze forth that the whole world might see, so the laws of\\r\\nthe world might intervene, the great natural laws by which alone these\\r\\nthings could be changed. I looked down at myself, then wasted to the\\r\\nbone, a stranger to the taste of wine or tobacco, to all the joys of\\r\\nlife, a miserable heart-broken wretch, and I cursed that old man and the\\r\\nthought of him till my lips were dry and my throat ached. I walked back\\r\\nto my miserable dwelling with a red fire before my eyes, muttering,\\r\\ncursing that power which stood behind the universe, and which we call\\r\\nGod, that there should be vomited forth into the world day by day, hour\\r\\nby hour, this black stream of human wretchedness, an everlasting mockery\\r\\nto those who would seek for the joy of life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They took me to the hospital, and they called my illness brain-fever.\\r\\nBut long before they thought me convalescent I was conscious, lying\\r\\nawake and plotting my escape. With cunning I managed it. Of my wife\\r\\nand child I never once thought. Every trace of human affection seemed\\r\\nwithered up in my heart. I took the money subscribed for me with a\\r\\nhypocrite\\'s smile, and I slunk away from England. I went to Montreal in\\r\\nCanada, and I deliberately entered upon a life of low pleasures. Pardon\\r\\nme!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bent forward and with a steady hand readjusted the shade of a lamp\\r\\nwhich was in danger of burning. Lady Caroom leaned back in her chair\\r\\nwith an indrawn sobbing breath. The action at such a moment seemed\\r\\ngrotesque. His own coolness, whilst with steady fingers he probed away\\r\\namongst the wounded places of his life, was in itself gruesome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My money,\" he continued, \"was no large sum, but I eked it out with\\r\\ngambling. The luck was always on my side. It\\'s quite true that I\\r\\nruined the father of the young lady who paid me a visit to-day. After a\\r\\nsomewhat chequered career he was settling down in a merchant\\'s office in\\r\\nMontreal when I met him. His luck at cards was as bad as mine was good.\\r\\nI won all he had, and more. I believe that he committed suicide. A man\\r\\nthere was kind to me, asked me to his house--I persuaded his wife to run\\r\\naway with me. These are amongst the slightest of my delinquencies. I\\r\\nsteeped myself in sin. I revelled in it. I seemed to myself in some\\r\\nway to be showing my defiance for the hidden powers of life which I had\\r\\ncursed. I played a match with evil by day and by night until I was\\r\\nglutted. And then I stole away from the city, leaving behind a hideous\\r\\nreputation and not a single friend. Then a new mood came to me. I\\r\\nwanted to get to a place where I should see no human beings at all, and\\r\\nescape in that way from the memories which were still like a clot upon\\r\\nmy brain. So I set my face westwards. I travelled till at last\\r\\ncivilization lay behind. Still I pushed onward. I had stores in\\r\\nplenty, an Indian servant who chanced to be faithful, and whom I saw\\r\\nbut twice a day. At last I reached Lake Ono. Here between us we built\\r\\na hut. I sent my Indian away then, and when he fawned at my feet to\\r\\nstay I kicked him. This was my third phase of living, and it was true\\r\\nthat some measure of sanity came back to me. Oh, the blessed relief of\\r\\nseeing the face of neither man nor woman. It was the unpeopled world of\\r\\nNature--uncorrupted, fresh, magnificent, alive by day and by night with\\r\\neverlasting music of Nature. The solitudes of those great forests were\\r\\nlike a wonderful balm. So the fevers were purged out of me, and I\\r\\nbecame once more an ordinary human being. I was content, I think, to\\r\\ndie there, for I had plenty to eat and drink, and the animals and birds\\r\\nwho came to me morning and evening kept me from even the thought of\\r\\nloneliness. The rest is obvious. I lost two cousins in South Africa,\\r\\nan uncle in the hunting-field. A man in Montreal had recognized me. I\\r\\nwas discovered. But before I returned I killed Brooks, the police-court\\r\\nmissionary. This girl has forced me to bring him to life again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a strange silence which followed. Brooks sat back in his chair,\\r\\npale, bewildered, striving to focus this story properly, to attain a\\r\\nproper comprehension of these new strange things. And behind all there\\r\\nsmouldered the slow burning anger of the child who has looked into the\\r\\nface of a deserted mother. Lady Caroom was white to the lips, and in\\r\\nher eyes the horror of that story so pitilessly told seemed still to\\r\\nlinger.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore spoke again. Still he sat back in his high-backed\\r\\nchair, and still he spoke in measured, monotonous tones. But this time,\\r\\nif only their ears had been quick enough to notice it, there lay behind\\r\\nan emotion, held in check indeed, but every now and then quivering for\\r\\nexpression. He had turned to Lady Caroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Chance,\" he said, \"has brought together here at the moment when the\\r\\ntelling of these things has become a necessity, the two people who have\\r\\nin a sense some right to hear them, for from each I have much to ask.\\r\\nSybil is your daughter, and from her there need be no secrets. So,\\r\\nCatherine, I ask you again, now that you know everything, are you brave\\r\\nenough to be my wife?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe raised her eyes, and he saw the horror there. But he made no sign.\\r\\nShe rose and held out her hand for Sybil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Arranmore,\" she said, \"I am afraid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked down upon his plate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So let it be, then,\" he said. \"It would need a brave woman indeed to\\r\\njoin her lot with mine after the things which I have told you. At\\r\\nheart, Catherine, I am almost a dead man. Believe me, you are wise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose, and the two women passed from the room. Then he resumed his\\r\\nformer seat, and attitude, and Brooks, though he tried to speak, felt\\r\\nhis tongue cleave to the roof of his mouth, a dry and nerveless thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor in these doings there was tragedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There remains to me you, Philip Kingston, my son,\" Lord Arranmore said,\\r\\nin the same measured tone. \"You also have before you the story of my\\r\\nlife, you are able from it to form some sort of idea as to what my\\r\\nfuture is likely to be. I do not wish to deceive you. My early\\r\\nenthusiasms are extinct. I look upon the ten or twenty years or so\\r\\nwhich may be left to me of life as merely a space of time to be filled\\r\\nwith as many amusements and new sensations as may be procurable without\\r\\nundue effort. I have no wish to convert, or perhaps pervert you, to my\\r\\nway of thinking. You live still in Utopia, and to me Utopia does not\\r\\nexist. So make your choice deliberately. Do you care to come to me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Brooks found words of a sort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Arranmore,\" he said, \"forgive me if what I must say sounds\\r\\nundutiful. I know that you have suffered. I can realize something of\\r\\nwhat you have been through. But your desertion of my mother and me was\\r\\na brutality. What you call your creed of life sounds to me hideous.\\r\\nYou and I are far apart, and so far as I am concerned, God grant that we\\r\\nmay remain so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time Lord Arranmore smiled. He poured out with steady\\r\\nhand yet another glass of wine, and he nodded towards the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am obliged to you,\" he said, \"for your candour. I have met with\\r\\nenough hypocrisy in life to be able to appreciate it. Be so good as to\\r\\nhumour my whim--and to leave me alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks rose from his seat, hesitated for a single moment, and left the\\r\\nroom. Lord Arranmore leaned back in his high-backed chair and looked\\r\\nround at the empty places. The cigarette burned out between his\\r\\nfingers, his wine remained untasted. The evening\\'s entertainment was\\r\\nover.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART II\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\nLORD ARRANMORE\\'S AMUSEMENTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The domestic virtues,\" Lord Arranmore said softly to himself, \"being\\r\\ndenied to me, the question remains how to pass one\\'s time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose wearily from his seat, and walking to the window looked out upon\\r\\nSt. James\\'s Square. A soft rain hung about the lamp-posts, the\\r\\npavements were thick with umbrellas. He returned to his chair with a\\r\\nshrug of the shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The only elucidation from outside seems to be a change of climate,\" he\\r\\nmused. \"I should prefer to think of something more original. In the\\r\\nmeantime I will write to that misguided young man in Medchester.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drew paper and pen towards him and began to write. Even his\\r\\nhandwriting seemed a part of the man--cold, shapely, and deliberate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My DEAR BROOKS,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been made acquainted through Mr. Ascough with your desire to\\r\\nleave the new firm of Morrison and Brooks, and while I congratulate you\\r\\nvery much upon the fact itself, I regret equally the course of reasoning\\r\\nwhich I presume led to your decision. You will probably have heard from\\r\\nMr. Ascough by this time on a matter of business. You are, by birth,\\r\\nLord Kingston of Ross, and the possessor of the Kingston income, which\\r\\namounts to a little over two thousand a year. Please remember that\\r\\nthis comes to you not through any grace or favour of mine, but by your\\r\\nown unalienable right as the eldest son of the Marquis of Arranmore.\\r\\nI cannot give it to you. I cannot withhold it from you. If you refuse\\r\\nto take it the amount must accumulate for your heirs, or in due time\\r\\nfind its way to the Crown. Leave the tithe alone by all means, if you\\r\\nlike, but do not carry quixotism to the borders of insanity by\\r\\ndeclining to spend your own money, and thereby cramp your life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I trust to hear from Mr. Ascough of your more reasonable frame of\\r\\nmind, and while personally I agree with you that we are better apart,\\r\\nyou can always rely upon me if I can be of any service to you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yours sincerely,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"ARRANMORE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe read the letter through thoughtfully and folded it up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I really don\\'t see what the young fool can kick about in that,\" he\\r\\nsaid, throwing it into the basket. \"Well, Hennibul, how are you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hennibul, duly ushered in by a sedate butler, pronounced himself\\r\\nboth in words and appearance fit and well. He took a chair and a\\r\\ncigarette, and looked about him approvingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nice house, yours, Arranmore. Nice old-fashioned situation, too. Why\\r\\ndon\\'t you entertain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No friends, no inclination, no womankind!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hennibul smiled incredulously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your card plate is chock-full,\" he said, \"and there are a dozen women\\r\\nin town at least of your connections who\\'d do the polite things by you.\\r\\nAs to inclination--well, one must do something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s about the most sensible thing you have said, Hennibul,\"\\r\\nArranmore remarked. \"I\\'ve just evoked the same fact out of my own\\r\\nconsciousness. One must do something. It\\'s tiresome, but it\\'s quite\\r\\ntrue.\" Politics?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hate \\'em! Not worth while anyway.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Travel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Done all I want for a bit, but I keep that in reserve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hunt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bad leg, but I do a bit at it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sooner go on the County Council.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"City.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Too much money already.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Write a book.\" \"No one would read it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Start a magazine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Too hard work.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hennibul sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re rather a difficult case,\" he admitted. \"You\\'d better come\\r\\nround to the club and play bridge.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never played whist--and I\\'m bad-tempered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bit of everything then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s what it\\'ll end in, I suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pleasant times we had down at Enton,\" Mr. Hennibul remarked. \"How\\'s\\r\\nthe nice young lawyer--Brooks his name was, I think?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, I believe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the ladies?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe that they are quite well. They were in Scotland last time\\r\\nI heard of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hennibul found conversation difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw that you were in Paris the other week,\" he remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went over to see Bernhardt\\'s new play,\" Arranmore continued.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It disappointed me. Very likely though the fault was with myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hennibul looked across at his host shrewdly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did you see me for?\" he asked, suddenly. \"You\\'re bored to death\\r\\ntrying to keep up a conversation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I don\\'t know, Hennibul,\" he answered. \"For the same old\\r\\nreason, I suppose. One must see some one, do something. I thought that\\r\\nyou might amuse me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I\\'ve failed,\" Hennibul declared, smiling. \"Come to supper at the\\r\\nSavoy to-night. The two new American girls from the Lyric and St. John\\r\\nLyttleton are to be there. Moderately respectable, I believe, but a bit\\r\\nnoisy perhaps.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re a good fellow, Hennibul,\" he said, \"but I\\'m too old for that\\r\\nsort of thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHennibul rose to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I\\'ve kept the best piece of advice till last because I\\r\\nwant you to think of it. Marry!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore did not smile. He did not immediately reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a bachelor!\" he remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am a man of a different disposition,\" Hennibul answered. \"I find\\r\\npleasure in everything--everything amuses me. My work is fascinating,\\r\\nmy playtime is never big enough. I really don\\'t know where a wife\\r\\nwould come in. However, if ever I did get a bit hipped, find myself\\r\\nin your position, for instance, I can promise you that I\\'d take my own\\r\\nmedicine. I\\'ve thought of it more than once lately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps by that time,\" Lord Arranmore said, \"the woman whom you wanted\\r\\nto marry wouldn\\'t have you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHennibul looked serious for a moment. A new idea had occurred to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One must take one\\'s chances!\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a philosopher,\" Arranmore declared. \"Will you have some\\r\\ntea--or a whisky-and-soda?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neither, thanks. In an abortive attempt to preserve my youth I neither\\r\\ntake tea nor drinks between meals. I will have one of your excellent\\r\\ncigarettes and get round to the club. Why, this is Enton over again,\\r\\nfor here comes Molyneux.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hon. Sydney Molyneux shook hands with both of them in somewhat\\r\\ndreary fashion, and embarked upon a few disjointed remarks. Hennibul\\r\\ntook his leave, and Arranmore yawned openly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter with you, Sydney?\" he asked. \"You are duller than\\r\\never. I am positively not going to sit here and mumble about the\\r\\nweather. How are the Carooms? Have you heard from them lately?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are up in Yorkshire,\" Molyneux announced, \"staying with the\\r\\nPryce-Powells. I believe they\\'re all right. I\\'m beastly fit myself,\\r\\nbut I had a bit of a facer last week. I--er--I wanted to ask you a\\r\\nquestion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About that fellow Brooks I met at your place down at Enton. Lawyer at\\r\\nMedchester, isn\\'t he? I thought that he and Sybil seemed a bit thick\\r\\nsomehow. Don\\'t suppose there could have been anything in it, eh? He\\'s\\r\\nno one in particular, I suppose. Lady Caroom wouldn\\'t be likely to\\r\\nlisten to anything between Sybil and him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore raised his eyebrows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Brooks is a very intelligent young man,\" he said, \"and some girls are\\r\\nattracted by brains, you know. I don\\'t know anything about his\\r\\nrelations with Sybil Caroom, but he has ample private means, and I\\r\\nbelieve that he is well-born.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fellow\\'s a gentleman, of course,\" Molyneux declared, \"but Lady Caroom\\r\\nis a little ambitious, isn\\'t she? I always seemed to be in the running\\r\\nall right lately. I spent last Sunday with them at Chelsom Castle.\\r\\nAwful long way to go, but I\\'m fond of Sybil. I thought she was a bit\\r\\ncool to me, but, like a fool, I blundered on, and in the end--I got a\\r\\nfacer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very sorry for you,\" Arranmore yawned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What made me think about Brooks was that she was awfully decent to me\\r\\nbefore Enton,\" Molyneux continued. \"I don\\'t mind telling you that I\\'m\\r\\nhard hit. I want to know who Brooks is. If he\\'s only a country lawyer,\\r\\nhe\\'s got no earthly chance with Lady Caroom, and Sybil\\'d never go\\r\\nagainst her mother. They\\'re too great pals for that. Never saw them so\\r\\nthick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was Lady Caroom--quite well?\" Arranmore asked, irrelevantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, now you mention it,\" Molyneux said, \"I don\\'t think she was quite\\r\\nin her usual form. She was much quieter, and it struck me that she was\\r\\naging a bit. Wonderful woman, though. She and Sybil were quite\\r\\ninseparable at Chelsom--more like sisters than anything, \\'pon my word.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore looked into the fire, and was silent for several minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So far as regards Brooks,\" he said, \"I do not think that he would be an\\r\\nacceptable son-in-law to Lady Caroom, but I am not in the least sure.\\r\\nHe is by no means an insignificant person. If he were really anxious to\\r\\nmarry Sybil Caroom, he would be a rival worth consideration. I cannot\\r\\ntell you anything more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Much obliged to you I\\'m sure. I shall try again when they come to\\r\\ntown, of course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore rose up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am going down to Christie\\'s to see some old French manuscripts,\" he\\r\\nsaid. \"Is that on your way?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMolyneux shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Going down to the House, thanks,\" he answered. \"I\\'ll look you up again\\r\\nsome time, if I may.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked out into the street together. Arranmore stepped into his\\r\\nbrougham and was driven off. At the top of St. James\\'s Street he\\r\\npulled the check-string and jumped out. He had caught a glimpse of a\\r\\ngirl\\'s face looking into a shop window. He hastily crossed the pavement\\r\\nand accosted her, hat in hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Scott, will you permit me the opportunity of saying a few words to\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary turned round, speechless for more than a minute or two.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not detain you for more than a minute or two. I hope that you\\r\\nwill not refuse me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will listen to anything you have to say, Lord Arranmore,\" she said,\\r\\n\"but let me tell you that I have been to see Mr. Ascough. He told me\\r\\nthat he had your permission to explain to me fully the reasons of your\\r\\ncoming to Montreal and the story of your life before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated. He stood before her, palpably anxiously waiting for her\\r\\ndecision.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was perhaps wrong to judge so hastily, Lord Arranmore,\" she said,\\r\\n\"and I am inclined to regret my visit to Enton. If you care to know it,\\r\\nI do not harbour any animosity towards you. But I cannot possibly\\r\\naccept this sum of money. I told Mr. Ascough so finally.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is only justice, Miss Scott,\" he said, in a low tone. \"I won the\\r\\nmoney from your father fairly in one sense, but unfairly in another, for\\r\\nI was a good player and he was a very poor one. You will do me a great,\\r\\nan immeasurable kindness, if you will allow me to make this\\r\\nrestitution.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If my forgiveness is of any value to you, Lord Arranmore,\" she said,\\r\\n\"you may have it. But I cannot accept the money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have consulted no one?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have a guardian or friends?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been living with my uncle, Mr. Bullsom. He has been very kind\\r\\nto me, and I have--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey both turned round. Selina and Mr. Bullsom had issued from the\\r\\nshop before which they stood, Both were looking at Lord Arranmore with\\r\\ncuriosity, in Selina\\'s case mixed with suspicion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this your uncle?\" he asked. \"Will you introduce me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary bit her lip.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Uncle, this is Lord Arranmore,\" she said. \"Mr. Bullsom, my cousin,\\r\\nMiss Bullsom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom retained presence of mind enough to remove a new and very\\r\\nshiny silk hat, and to extend a yellow, dog-skinned gloved hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very proud to meet your lordship,\" he declared. \"I--I wasn\\'t aware--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore extricated his hand from a somewhat close grasp, and\\r\\nbowed to Selina.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are neighbours, you know, Mr. Bullsom,\" he said, \"at Medchester. I\\r\\nmet your niece there, and recognized her at once, though she was a\\r\\nlittle slip of a girl when I knew her last. Her father and I were in\\r\\nMontreal together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless my soul,\" Mr. Bullsom exclaimed, in much excitement. \"It\\'s\\r\\nyour lawyers, then, who have been advertising for Mary?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is so,\" he admitted. \"I am sorry to say that I cannot induce your\\r\\nniece to look upon a certain transaction between her father and myself\\r\\nfrom a business-like point of view. I think that you and I, Mr.\\r\\nBullsom, might come to a better understanding. Will you give me an\\r\\nappointment? I should like to discuss the matter with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With the utmost pleasure, my lord,\" Mr. Bullsom declared heartily.\\r\\n\"Can\\'t expect these young ladies to see through a business matter, eh?\\r\\nI will come to your lordship\\'s house whenever you like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be quite useless, uncle,\" Mary interposed, firmly. \"Lord\\r\\nArranmore has already my final answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom was a little excited.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tut, tut, child!\" he exclaimed. \"Don\\'t talk nonsense. I should be\\r\\nproud to talk this matter over with Lord Arranmore. We are staying at\\r\\nthe Metropole, and if your lordship would call there to-morrow and take\\r\\na bit of lunch, eh, about one o\\'clock--if it isn\\'t too great a liberty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina had never loved her father more sincerely. Lord Arranmore smiled\\r\\nfaintly, but good-humoredly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are exceedingly kind,\" he said. \"For our business talk, perhaps,\\r\\nit would be better if you would come to St. James\\'s House at, say,\\r\\n10:30, if that is convenient. I will send a carriage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll be ready prompt,\" Mr. Bullsom declared. \"Now, girls, we will say\\r\\ngood-afternoon to his lordship and get a four-wheeler.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina raised her eyes and dropped them again in the most approved\\r\\nfashion. Mr. Bullsom shook hands as though it were a sacrament; Mary,\\r\\nwho was annoyed, did not smile at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is all quite unnecessary, Lord Arranmore,\" she said, while her\\r\\nuncle was signalling for a cab. I shall not change my mind, and I am\\r\\nsorry that you spoke to uncle about it at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a serious matter to me, Miss Scott,\" Lord Arranmore said,\\r\\ngravely. \"And there is still another point of view from which I might\\r\\nurge it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is wasted time,\" she declared, firmly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina detached herself from her father, and stood by Lord Arranmore\\'s\\r\\nside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose you are often in London, Lord Arranmore?\" she asked shyly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great deal too often,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We read about your beautiful parties at Enton,\" she said, with a sigh.\\r\\n\"It is such a lovely place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad you like it,\" he answered, absently. \"I see your uncle\\r\\ncannot find a four-wheeler. You must take my carriage. I am only going\\r\\na few steps.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s eager protest was drowned in Selina\\'s shrill torrent of thanks.\\r\\nLord Arranmore beckoned to his coachman, and the brougham, with its pair\\r\\nof strong horses, drew up against the pavement. The footman threw open\\r\\nthe door. Selina entered in a fever for fear a cab which her father was\\r\\nsignalling should, after all, respond to his summons. Mr. Bullsom\\r\\nfound his breath taken away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We couldn\\'t possibly take your lordship\\'s carriage,\" he protested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have only a few steps to go, Mr. Bullsom, and it would be a\\r\\nkindness, for my horses are never more than half exercised. At 10:30\\r\\nto-morrow then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood bareheaded upon the pavement for a moment, and Selina\\'s eyes\\r\\nand smile had never worked harder. Mary leaned back, too angry to\\r\\nspeak. Selina and Mr. Bullsom sat well forward, and pulled both\\r\\nwindows down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HECKLING OF HENSLOW\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The long and short of it is, then, Mr. Henslow, that you decline to\\r\\nfulfil your pledges given at the last election?\" Brooks asked, coldly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing of the sort,\" Mr. Henslow declared, testily. \"You have no\\r\\nright to suggest anything of the sort.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No right!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not. You are my agent, and you ought to work with me instead--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have already told you,\" Brooks interrupted, \\'\"that I am nothing of the\\r\\nsort. I should not dream of acting for you again, and if you think a\\r\\nformal resignation necessary, I will post you one to-morrow. I am one\\r\\nof your constituents, nothing more or less. But as I am in some measure\\r\\nresponsible for your presence here, I consider myself within my rights\\r\\nin asking you these questions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m not going to be hectored!\" Mr. Henslow declared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nobody wants to hector you! You gave certain pledges to us, and you\\r\\nhave not fulfilled one of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They won\\'t let me. I\\'m not here as an independent Member. I\\'m here as\\r\\na Liberal, and Sir Henry himself struck out my proposed question and\\r\\nmotion. I must go with the Party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know quite well,\" Brooks said, \"that you are within your rights in\\r\\nkeeping the pledges you made to the mass meeting at Medchester.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHenslow shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be no good,\" he declared. \"I\\'ve sounded lots of men about it.\\r\\nI myself have not changed. I believe in some measure of protection. I\\r\\nam a firm believer in it. But the House wouldn\\'t listen to me. The\\r\\ntimes are not ripe for anything of the sort yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you know until you try?\" Brooks protested. \"Your promise was to\\r\\nbring the question before Parliament in connection with the vast and\\r\\nincreasing number of unemployed. You are within your rights in doing\\r\\nso, and to speak frankly we insist upon it, or we ask for your\\r\\nresignation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you speaking with authority, young man?\" Mr. Henslow asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I am. I am the representative of the Liberal Parliamentary\\r\\nCommittee, and I am empowered to say these things to you, and more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'ll do the best I can to get a date,\" Mr. Henslow said,\\r\\ngrumblingly, \"but you fellows are always in such a hurry, and you don\\'t\\r\\nunderstand that it don\\'t go up here. We have to wait our time month\\r\\nafter month sometimes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t see any motion down in your name at all yet,\" Brooks remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I told you that Sir Henry struck it through.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I shall call upon him and point out that he is throwing away a\\r\\nLiberal seat at the next election,\" Brooks replied. \"He isn\\'t the sort\\r\\nof man to encourage a Member to break his election pledges.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll make a mess of the whole thing if you do anything of the sort,\"\\r\\nHenslow declared. \"Look here, come and have a bit of dinner with me,\\r\\nand talk things over a bit more pleasantly, eh? There\\'s no use in\\r\\ngetting our rags out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please excuse me,\" Brooks said. \"I have arranged to dine elsewhere. I\\r\\ndo not wish to seem dictatorial or unreasonable, but I have just come\\r\\nfrom Medchester, where the distress is, if anything, worse than ever.\\r\\nIt makes one\\'s heart sick to walk the streets, and when I look into the\\r\\npeople\\'s faces I seem to always hear that great shout of hope and\\r\\nenthusiasm which your speech in the market-place evoked. You see, there\\r\\nis only one real hope for these people, and that is legislation, and you\\r\\nare the man directly responsible to them for that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell you what I\\'ll do!\" Mr. Henslow said, in a burst of\\r\\ngenerosity. \"I\\'ll send another ten guineas to the Unemployed Fund.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take my advice and don\\'t,\" Brooks answered, dryly. \"They might be\\r\\nreminded of the people who clamoured for bread and were offered a stone.\\r\\nDo your duty here. Keep your pledges. Speak in the House with the same\\r\\npassion and the same eloquence as when you sowed hope in the heart of\\r\\nthose suffering thousands. Some one must break away from this musty\\r\\nroutine of Party politics. The people will be heard, Mr. Henslow.\\r\\nTheir voice has dominated the fate of every nation in time, and it will\\r\\nbe so with ours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Henslow was silent for a few minutes. This young man who would\\r\\nnot drink champagne, or be hail-fellow-well-met, and who was in such\\r\\ndeadly earnest, was a nuisance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you what I\\'ll do,\" he said at last. \"I\\'ll have a few words with\\r\\nSir Henry, and see you tomorrow at what time you like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" Brooks answered, rising. \"If you will allow me to make a\\r\\nsuggestion, Mr. Henslow, I would ask you to run through in your memory\\r\\nall your speeches and go through your pledges one by one. Let Sir Henry\\r\\nunderstand that your constituents will not be trifled with, for it is\\r\\nnot a question of another candidate, it is a question of another party.\\r\\nYou have set the ball rolling, and I can assure you that the next Member\\r\\nwhom Medchester sends here, whether it be you or any one else, will come\\r\\nfully pledged to a certain measure of Protection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Henslow nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well,\" he said, gloomily. \"Where are you staying?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the Metropole. Mr. Bullsom is there also.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will call,\" Mr. Henslow promised, \"at three o\\'clock, if that is\\r\\nconvenient.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks passed out across the great courtyard and through the gates. He\\r\\nhad gone to his interview with Henslow in a somewhat depressed state of\\r\\nmind, and its result had not been enlivening. Were all politics like\\r\\nthis? Was the greatest of causes, the cause of the people, to be tossed\\r\\nabout from one to the other, a joke with some, a juggling ball with\\r\\nothers, never to be dealt with firmly and wisely by the brains and\\r\\ngenerosity of the Empire? He looked back at the Houses of Parliament,\\r\\nwith their myriad lights, their dark, impressive outline. And for a\\r\\nmoment the depression passed away. He thought of the freedom which had\\r\\nbeen won within those walls, of the gigantic struggles, the endless,\\r\\nrestless journeying onward towards the truths, the great truths of the\\r\\nworld. All politicians were not as this man Henslow. There were\\r\\nothers, more strenuous, more single-hearted. He himself--and his heart\\r\\nbeat at the thought--why should he not take his place there? The thought\\r\\nfascinated him,--every word of Lord Arranmore\\'s letter which he had\\r\\nrecently received, seemed to stand out before him. His feet fell more\\r\\nblithely upon the pavement, he carried himself with a different air.\\r\\nHere were ample means to fill his life,--means by which he could crush\\r\\nout that sweet but unhappy tangle of memories which somehow or other had\\r\\nstolen the flavour out of life for the last few weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the hotel he glanced at the clock. It was just eight, and he was to\\r\\naccompany the Bullsoms to the theatre. He met them in the hall, and\\r\\nSelina looked with reproach at his morning clothes. She was wearing a\\r\\nnew swansdown theatre cloak, with a collar which she had turned up round\\r\\nher face like a frame. She was convinced that she had never looked so\\r\\nwell in her life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Brooks, how naughty of you,\" she exclaimed, shaking her head in\\r\\nmock reproach. \"Why, the play begins at 8:15, and it is eight o\\'clock\\r\\nalready. Have you had dinner?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I can manage with something in my room while I change,\" he answered\\r\\ncheerily. \"I\\'m going to take you all out to supper after the theatre,\\r\\nyou know. Don\\'t wait for me--I\\'ll come on. His Majesty\\'s, isn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll keep your seat,\" Selina promised him, lowering her voice. \"That\\r\\nis, if you are very good and come before it is half over. Do you know\\r\\nthat we met a friend of yours, and he lent us his carriage, and I think\\r\\nhe\\'s charming.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks looked surprised. He glanced at Mary, and saw a look in her face\\r\\nwhich came as a revelation to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t mean--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Arranmore!\" Selina declared, triumphantly. \"He was so nice, he\\r\\nwouldn\\'t let us come home in a cab. He positively made us take his own\\r\\ncarriage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom came hurrying up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cab waiting,\" he announced. \"Come on, girls.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See you later, then, Brooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks changed his clothes leisurely, and went into the smoking-room for\\r\\nsome sandwiches and a glass of wine. A small boy shouting his number\\r\\nattracted his attention. He called him, and was handed a card.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Arranmore!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can show the gentleman here,\" Brooks directed.\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore came in, and nodded a little wearily to Brooks, whom he had\\r\\nnot seen since the latter had left Enton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I won\\'t keep you,\" he remarked. \"I just wanted a word with you about\\r\\nthat obstinate young person Miss--er--Scott.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks wheeled an easy-chair towards him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am in no great hurry,\" he remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore glanced at the clock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More am I,\" he said, \"but I find I am dining with the Prime Minister at\\r\\nnine o\\'clock. It occurs to me that you may have some influence with\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are on fairly friendly terms,\" Brooks admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just so. Well, she may have told you that my solicitors approached\\r\\nher, as the daughter of Martin Scott, with the offer of a certain sum of\\r\\nmoney, which is only a fair and reasonable item, which I won from her\\r\\nfather at a time when we were not playing on equal terms. It was\\r\\nthrough that she found me out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I knew as much as that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I imagined. But the hot-headed young woman has up to now steadily\\r\\nrefused to accept anything whatever from me. Quite ridiculous of her.\\r\\nThere\\'s no doubt that I broke up the happy home, and all that sort of\\r\\nthing, and I really can\\'t see why she shouldn\\'t permit me the\\r\\nopportunity of making some restitution.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You want her to afford you the luxury of salving your conscience,\"\\r\\nBrooks remarked, dryly.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore laughed hardly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Conscience,\" he repeated. \"You ought to know me better, Brooks, than\\r\\nto suppose me possessed of such a thing. No; I have a sense of justice,\\r\\nthat is all--a sort of weakness for seeing the scales held fairly. Now,\\r\\ndon\\'t you think it is reasonable that she should accept this money from\\r\\nme?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It depends entirely upon how she feels,\" Brooks answered. \"You have no\\r\\nright to press it upon her if she has scruples. Nor have you any right\\r\\nto try and enlist her family on your side, as you seem to be doing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWill you discuss it with her?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should not attempt to influence her,\" Brooks answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be reasonable, Brooks. The money can make no earthly difference to\\r\\nme, and it secures for her independence. The obligation, if only a\\r\\nmoral one, is real enough. There is no question of charity. Use your\\r\\ninfluence with her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have great confidence in Miss Scott\\'s own judgment,\" he said. \"I\\r\\nprefer not to interfere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore sat quite still for a moment. Then he rose slowly to his\\r\\nfeet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry to have troubled you,\" he said. \"The world seems to have\\r\\ngrown more quixotic since I knew it better. I am almost afraid to ask\\r\\nyou whether my last letter has yet received the favour of your\\r\\nconsideration.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks flushed a little at the biting sarcasm in Arranmore\\'s tone, but\\r\\nhe restrained himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have considered--the matter fully,\" he said; \"and I have talked it\\r\\nover with Mr. Ascough. There seems to be no reason why I should refuse\\r\\nthe income to which I seem to be entitled.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore nodded and lit a cigarette.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am thankful,\" he said, dryly, \"for so much common-sense. Mr.\\r\\nAscough will put you in possession of a banking account at any moment.\\r\\nShould you consider it--well--intrusive on my part if I were to inquire\\r\\nas to your plans?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are as yet not wholly formed,\" he said, \"but I am thinking of\\r\\nstudying social politics for some time here in London with the intention\\r\\nof entering public life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A very laudable ambition,\" Lord Arranmore answered. \"If I can be of\\r\\nany assistance to you, I trust that you will not fail to let me know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thank you,\" Brooks answered. \"I shall not require any assistance\\r\\nfrom you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore winced perceptibly. Brooks, who would not have believed\\r\\nhim capable of such a thing, for a moment doubted his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am much obliged for your candour,\" Lord Arranmore said, coldly, and\\r\\nwith complete self-recovery. \"Don\\'t trouble to come to the door.\\r\\nGood-evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks was alone. He sat down in one of the big easy-chairs, and for a\\r\\nmoment forgot that empty stall next to Selina. He had seen the first\\r\\nsign of weakness in a man whom he had judged to be wholly and entirely\\r\\nheartless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\nMARY SCOTT\\'S TWO VISITORS\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I AM sure,\" he said, \"that Selina would consider this most improper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite right,\" Mary assured him, laughing. \"It was one of the\\r\\nfirst things she mentioned. When I told her that I should ask any one\\r\\nto tea I liked she was positively indignant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is hard to believe that you are cousins,\" he remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were brought up very differently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked around him. He was in a tiny sitting-room of a tiny flat high\\r\\nup in a great building. Out of the window he seemed to look down upon\\r\\nthe Ferris wheel. Inside everything was cramped but cosy. Mary Scott\\r\\nsat behind the tea-tray, and laughed at his expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will read your thoughts,\" she exclaimed. \"You are wondering how you\\r\\nwill get out of this room without knocking anything over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the contrary,\" he answered, \"I was wondering how I ever got in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You were really very clever. Now do have some more tea, and tell me\\r\\nall the news.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will have the tea, if you please,\" he answered, \"and you shall have\\r\\nthe news, such as it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"First of all then,\" she said, \"I hear that you are leaving Medchester,\\r\\ngiving up your business and coming to live in London, and that you have\\r\\nhad some money left you. Do you know that all this sounds very\\r\\nmysterious?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I admit it,\" he answered, slowly stirring his tea. \"Yet in the\\r\\nmain--it is true.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How nice to hear all about it,\" she sighed, contentedly. \"You know I\\r\\nhave scarcely had a word with you while my uncle and cousins were up.\\r\\nSelina monopolized you most disgracefully.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her with twinkling eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Selina was very amusing,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You seemed to find her so,\" she answered. \"But Selina isn\\'t here now,\\r\\nand you have to entertain me. You are really going to live in London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have taken rooms!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Delightful. Whereabouts?\" \"In Jermyn Street!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And are you going to practise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I shall have enough to live on. I am going to study social\\r\\nsubjects and politics generally.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are going into Parliament?\" she exclaimed, breathlessly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some day, perhaps,\" he answered, hesitatingly. \"If I can find a\\r\\nconstituency.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was silent for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, I think I rather dislike you,\" she said. \"I envy you most\\r\\nhideously.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What an evil nature!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'ve never denied it. I\\'m dreadfully envious of people who have\\r\\nthe chance of doing things, whose limitations are not chalked out on the\\r\\nblackboard before them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, well, you yourself are not at Medchester now,\" he reminded her.\\r\\n\"You have kicked your own limitation away. Literature is as wide a\\r\\nfield as politics.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is true enough,\" she answered. \"I must not grumble. After\\r\\nMedchester this is elysium. But literature is a big name to give my\\r\\nlittle efforts. I\\'m just a helper on a lady\\'s threepenny paper, and\\r\\nbetween you and me I don\\'t believe they think much of my work yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely they haven\\'t been discouraging you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, they have been very kind. But they keep on assuring me that I am\\r\\nbound to improve, and the way they use the blue pencil! However, it\\'s\\r\\nonly the journalist\\'s part they go for. The little stories are all\\r\\nright still.\\'\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should think so,\" he declared, warmly. \"I think they are charming.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How nice you are,\" she sighed. \"No wonder Selina didn\\'t like going\\r\\nhome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her in amused wonder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know,\" he said, \"you are getting positively frivolous. I don\\'t\\r\\nrecognize you. I never saw such a change.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe leaned back in her chair, laughing heartily, her eyes bright, her\\r\\nbeautiful white teeth in delightful evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I suppose it\\'s the sense of freedom,\" she exclaimed. \"It\\'s\\r\\ndelightful, isn\\'t it? Medchester had got on my nerves. I hated it.\\r\\nOne saw nothing but the ugly side of life, day after day. It was\\r\\nhideously depressing. Here one can breathe. There\\'s room for every\\r\\none.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The change agrees with you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not. I feel years younger. Think how much there is to do, and\\r\\nsee, even for a pauper like myself--picture galleries, the shops, the\\r\\npeople, the theatres.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t think me a prig, will you?\" he said, \"but I want to understand\\r\\nyou. In Medchester you used to work for the people--it was the greater\\r\\npart of your life. You are not giving that up altogether, are you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed him to scorn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Am I such a butterfly? No, I hope to get some serious work to do, and\\r\\nI am looking forward to it. I have a letter of introduction to a Mrs.\\r\\nCapenhurst, whom I am going to see on Sunday. I expect to learn a lot\\r\\nfrom her. I was very, very sorry to leave my own girls. It was the\\r\\nonly regret I had in leaving Medchester. By the bye, what is this about\\r\\nMr. Henslow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are thinking of asking him to resign,\" Brooks answered. \"He has\\r\\nbeen a terrible disappointment to us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry. From his speeches he seemed such an excellent candidate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was a magnificent candidate,\" Brooks said ruefully, \"but a shocking\\r\\nMember. I am afraid what I heard in the City the other day must have\\r\\nsome truth in it. They say that he only wanted to be able to write M.P.\\r\\nafter his name for this last session to get on the board of two new\\r\\ncompanies. He will never sit for Medchester again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was at the hotel the other day, wasn\\'t he?\" Mary asked, \"with you\\r\\nand uncle? What has he to say for himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, he shelters himself behind the old fudge about duty to his\\r\\nParty,\" Brooks answered. \"You see the Liberals only just scraped in\\r\\nlast election because of the war scandals, and their majority is too\\r\\nsmall for them to care about any of the rank and file introducing any\\r\\ndisputative measures. Still that scarcely affects the question. He won\\r\\nhis seat on certain definite pledges, and if he persists in his present\\r\\nattitude, we shall ask him at once to resign.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou still keep up your interest in Medchester, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, yes!\" he answered. \"Between ourselves, if I could choose, I would\\r\\nrather, when the time comes, stand for Medchester than anywhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad! I should like to see you Member for Medchester. Do you\\r\\nknow, even now, although I am so happy, I cannot think about the last\\r\\nfew months there without a shudder. It seemed to me that things were\\r\\ngetting worse and worse. The people\\'s faces haunt me sometimes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked up at her sympathetically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you have once lived with them,\" he said, \"once really understood,\\r\\nyou never can forget. You can travel or amuse yourself in any way, but\\r\\ntheir faces are always coming before you, their voices seem always in\\r\\nyour ears. It is the one eternal sadness of life. And the strangest\\r\\npart of it is, that just as you who have once really understood can\\r\\nnever forget, so it is the most difficult thing in the world to make\\r\\nthose people understand who have not themselves lived and toiled\\r\\namongst them. It is a cry which you cannot translate, but if once you\\r\\nhave heard it, it will follow you from the earth to the stars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You too, then,\" she said, \"have some of the old aim at heart. You are\\r\\nnot going to immerse yourself wholly in politics?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My studies,\" he said, \"will be in life. It is not from books that I\\r\\nhope to gain experience. I want to get a little nearer to the heart of\\r\\nthe thing. You and I may easily come across one another, even in this\\r\\ngreat city.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You,\" she said, \"are going to watch, to observe, to trace the external\\r\\nonly that you may understand the internal. But I am going to work on my\\r\\nhands and knees.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you think that I am going to play the dilettante?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not altogether. But you will want to pass from one scheme to another\\r\\nto see the inner workings of all. I shall be content to find occupation\\r\\nin any one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall be coming to you,\" he said, \"for information and help.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I doubt it,\" she answered, cheerfully. \"Never mind! It is pleasant to\\r\\nbuild castles, and we may yet find ourselves working side by side.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe suddenly looked at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have answered all your questions,\" he said. \"There is something\\r\\nabout you which I should like to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure you shall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Arranmore came to me when I was staying at the Metropole with your\\r\\nuncle and cousin. He wished me to use my influence with you to induce\\r\\nyou to accept a certain sum of money which it seemed that you had\\r\\nalready declined.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I refused. In the first place, as I told him, I was not\\r\\naware that I possessed any influence over you. And in the second I had\\r\\nevery confidence in your own judgment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was suddenly very thoughtful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My own judgment,\" she repeated. \"I am afraid that I have lost a good\\r\\ndeal of faith in that lately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have learned to repent of that impulsive visit of mine to Enton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Again why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was mad with rage against Lord Arranmore. I think that I was wrong.\\r\\nIt was many years ago, and he has repented.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks smiled faintly. The idea of Lord Arranmore repenting of anything\\r\\nappealed in some measure to his sense of humour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I am afraid that I did him some great harm in accusing him like\\r\\nthat--openly. He has seemed to me since like an altered man. Tell me,\\r\\nthose others who were there--they believed me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It did him harm--with the lady, the handsome woman who was playing\\r\\nbilliards with him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was he engaged to her?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! He proposed to her afterwards, and she refused him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eyes were suddenly dim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think,\" he said, quietly, \"that you need not be. You probably saved\\r\\nher a good deal of unhappiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him curiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why are you so bitter against Lord Arranmore?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I?\" he laughed. \"I am not bitter against him. Only I believe him to\\r\\nbe a man without heart or conscience or principles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is your opinion--really?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really! Decidedly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I don\\'t agree with you,\" she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Simply that I don\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent! But you have reasons as well as convictions?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps. Why, for instance, is he so anxious for me to have this\\r\\nmoney? That must be a matter of conscience?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not necessarily. An accident might bring his Montreal career to light.\\r\\nHis behaviour towards you would be an excellent defence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He isn\\'t mean enough to think so far ahead for his own advantage.\\r\\nVillain or paragon, he is on a large scale, your Lord Arranmore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has had the good fortune,\" Brooks said, with a note of satire in his\\r\\ntone, \"to attract your sympathies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not? I struck hard enough at him, and he has borne me no ill-will.\\r\\nHe even made friends with Selina and my uncle to induce me to accept his\\r\\nwell, conscience money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I need not ask you what the result was,\" Brooks said. \"You declined\\r\\nit, of course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I refused it at first, as you know,\" she said. \"Since then, well, I\\r\\nhave wavered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her blankly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean--that you have contemplated--accepting it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not? There is reason in it. I do not say that I have accepted it,\\r\\nbut at any rate I see nothing which should make you look upon my\\r\\npossible acceptance as a heinous thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was silent for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I ask you then what the position is?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will tell you. Lord Arranmore is coming to me perhaps this afternoon\\r\\nfor my answer. I asked him for a few days to think it over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And your decision--is it ready?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I don\\'t think it is,\" she admitted. \"To tell you the truth, I\\r\\nshall not decide until he is actually here--until I have heard just how\\r\\nhe speaks of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got up and stood for a moment looking out of the window. Then he\\r\\nturned suddenly towards her with outstretched hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am going--Miss Scott. Good-afternoon.\" She rose and held out her\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aren\\'t you--a little abrupt?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps I am. I think that it is better that I should go away now.\\r\\nThere are reasons why I do not want to talk about Lord Arranmore, or\\r\\ndiscuss this matter with you, and if I stayed I might do both. Will you\\r\\ndine with me somewhere on Friday night? I will come and fetch you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I will. Do be careful how you walk. About 7:30.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will be here by then,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the last flight of stone steps he came face to face with Lord\\r\\nArranmore, who nodded and pointed upwards with his walking-stick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How much of this sort of thing?\" he asked, dryly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ten storeys,\" Brooks answered, and passed out into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore looked after him--watched him until he was out of sight.\\r\\nThen he stood irresolute for several moments, tapping his boots.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Damned young fool!\" he muttered at last; and began the ascent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nA MARQUIS ON MATRIMONY\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Miss Scott,\" Lord Arranmore said, settling himself in the most\\r\\ncomfortable of her fragile easy-chairs, and declining tea. \"I cannot\\r\\nfail to perceive that my cause is hopeless. The united efforts of\\r\\nmyself and your worthy relatives appear to be powerless to unearth a\\r\\nsingle grain of common-sense in your--er--pardon me--singularly\\r\\nobstinate disposition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA subdued smile played at the corners of her mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am delighted that you are convinced, Lord Arranmore,\" she said. \"It\\r\\nwill save us both a good deal of time and breath.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well--as to that I am not so sure,\" he answered, deliberately. \"You\\r\\nforget that there is still an important matter to be decided.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him questioningly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The disposal of the money, of course,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The disposal of it? But that has nothing to do with me!\" she declared.\\r\\n\"I refuse to touch it--to have anything to do with it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see,\" he explained, \"I have placed it, or rather my solicitors\\r\\nhave, in trust. Actually you may decline, as you are doing, to have\\r\\nanything to do with it--legally you cannot avoid your responsibilities.\\r\\nThat money cannot be touched without your signature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed a little indignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you had better withdraw it from trust, or whatever you call it, at\\r\\nonce. If it was there until I was eighty I should never touch it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understand that perfectly,\" Lord Arranmore said. \"You have refused\\r\\nit. Very well! What are we going to do with it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Put it back where it came from, of course,\" she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" he said, \"by signing several papers that might be managed. In\\r\\nthat case I should distribute it amongst the various public-houses in\\r\\nthe East End to provide drinks for the thirstiest of their customers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you think that,\" she said, scornfully, \"a reputable use to make of\\r\\nyour money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held out his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Miss Scott. Our money!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The money,\" she exclaimed. \"I repeat, the money. Well, there is\\r\\nnothing more to be said about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you sign the papers which authorize me to distribute the money in\\r\\nthis way?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thought for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; I will not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly. You would be very foolish and very untrue to your principles\\r\\nif you did. So you see, this sum is not to be foisted altogether upon\\r\\nme, for there is no doubt that I should misuse it. Now I believe that\\r\\nif you were to give the matter a little consideration you could hit upon\\r\\na more reasonable manner of laying out this sum. Don\\'t interrupt me,\\r\\nplease. My own views as to charity you know. You however look at the\\r\\nmatter from an altogether different point of view. Let us leave it\\r\\nwhere it is for the moment. Something may occur to you within the next\\r\\nfew months. Don\\'t let it be a hospital, if you can help it--something\\r\\naltogether original would be best. Set your brain to work. I shall be\\r\\nat your service at any moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose to his feet and began slowly to collect his belongings. Then\\r\\ntheir eyes met, and she burst out laughing--he too smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very ingenious, Lord Arranmore,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is my conscience,\" he assured her. \"It is out of gear to the tune\\r\\nof three thousand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe in the conscience,\" she answered. \\'This is sheer\\r\\nobstinacy. You have made up your mind that I should be interested in\\r\\nthat money somehow, and you can\\'t bear to suffer defeat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am an old man,\" he said, \"and you are a young woman. Let us leave it\\r\\nwhere it is for a while. I have an idea of the sort of life which you\\r\\nare planning for yourself. Believe me, that before you have lived here\\r\\nfor many months you will be willing to give years of your life, years of\\r\\nyour labour and your youth, to throw yourself into a struggle which\\r\\nwithout money is hopeless. Remember that there was a time when I too\\r\\nwas young. I too saw these things as you and Brooks see them to-day. I\\r\\ndo not wish to preach pessimism to you. I fought and was worsted. So\\r\\nwill you be. The whole thing is a vast chimera, a jest of the God you\\r\\nhave made for yourself. But as long as the world lasts the young will\\r\\nhave to buy knowledge--as I have bought it. Don\\'t go into the fray\\r\\nempty-handed--it will only prolong the suffering.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You speak,\" she protested, gently, \"as though it were impossible to do\\r\\ngood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is absolutely and entirely impossible to do good by any means which\\r\\nyou and Brooks and the whole army of your fellow-philanthropists have\\r\\nyet evoked,\" he answered, with a sudden fierce note in his tone. \"Don\\'t\\r\\nthink that I speak to you as a cynic, one who loiters on the edge of the\\r\\ncauldron and peers in to gratify cravings for sensation. I have been\\r\\nthere, down in the thick of it, there where the mud is as black as\\r\\nhell--bottomless as eternity. I was young--as you--mad with enthusiasm.\\r\\nI had faith, strength, belief. I meant to cleanse the world. I\\r\\nworked till the skin hung on my bones. I gave all that I\\r\\nhad--youth--gifts--money. And, do you know what I was doing? I was\\r\\nswimming against the tide of natural law, stronger than all mankind,\\r\\nunconquerable, eternal. There wasn\\'t the smallest corner of the world\\r\\nthe better for my broken life. There wasn\\'t a child, a man, or a woman\\r\\ncontent to grasp my hand and climb out. There were plenty who mocked\\r\\nme. But they fell back again. They fell back always.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, but you can\\'t tell that,\" she cried. \"You can\\'t be sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can be as sure of it as of life itself,\" he answered. \"Come, take\\r\\nmy advice. I know. I can save you a broken youth--a broken heart.\\r\\nKeep away from there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pointed out of the window eastwards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can be charitable like the others, subscribe to societies, visit\\r\\nthe sick, read the Bible, play at it as long as you like--but keep away\\r\\nfrom the real thing. If you feel the fever in your veins--fly. Go\\r\\nabroad, study art, literature, music--anything. Only don\\'t listen to\\r\\nthat cry. It will draw you against your will even. But not you nor the\\r\\nwhole world of women, or the world full of gold, will ever stop it. It\\r\\nis the everlasting legacy to the world of outraged nature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went swiftly and silently, leaving her motionless. She saw him far\\r\\ndown on the pavement below step into his brougham, pausing for a moment\\r\\nto light a cigarette. And half-an-hour later he walked with elastic\\r\\ntread into Mr. Ascough\\'s office.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Ascough greeted him with an inquiring smile. Lord Arranmore\\r\\nnodded and sat down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You were quite right,\" he announced. \"The tongues of men or of angels\\r\\nwouldn\\'t move her. Never mind. She\\'s going to use the money for\\r\\ncharity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, that\\'s something, at any rate,\" Mr. Ascough remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The eloquence,\" Lord Arranmore said, lazily, \"which I have wasted upon\\r\\nthat young woman would entrance the House of Lords. By the bye,\\r\\nAscough, I am going to take my seat next week.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am delighted to hear it, your lordship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it\\'s good news for the country, isn\\'t it?\" Lord Arranmore\\r\\nremarked. \"I have not quite decided what my particular line shall be,\\r\\nbut I have no doubt but that the papers will all be calling me a welcome\\r\\naddition to that august assembly before long. I believe that\\'s what\\'s\\r\\nthe matter with me. I want to make a speech. Do you remember me at the\\r\\nBar, Ascough? Couldn\\'t keep me down, could they?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Ascough smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You were rather fond of being on your feet!\" he admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore sighed regretfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And to think that I might have been Lord High Chancellor by now,\" he\\r\\nremarked. \"Good-bye, Ascough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n              *     *     *     *     *\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, at the reception of a Cabinet Minister, Lord Arranmore came\\r\\nacross Hennibul talking with half-a-dozen other men. He detached himself\\r\\nat once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is odd,\" he remarked, with a whimsical smile. \"What the dickens\\r\\nare you doing in this respectable household, Arranmore? You look like a\\r\\nlost sheep.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve decided to go in for something,\" he said; \"politics or society or\\r\\nsomething of that sort. What do you recommend?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Supper!\" Mr. Hennibul answered, promptly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on then,\" Lord Arranmore assented. \"One of those little tables in\\r\\nthe far room, eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The pate here is delicious,\" Mr. Hennibul said; \"but for Heaven\\'s sake\\r\\nleave the champagne alone.\" \"There\\'s some decent hock. You\\'ll excuse my\\r\\npointing out these little things to you, but, of course, you don\\'t know\\r\\nthe runs yet. I\\'ll give you a safe tip while I\\'m about it. The\\r\\nOpposition food is beastly, but the wine is all right--Pommery and\\r\\nHeidsieck, most of it, and the right years. The Government food now is\\r\\ngood, but the wine, especially the champagne, is positively unholy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One should eat then with the Government, and drink with the\\r\\nOpposition,\" Lord Arranmore remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or, better still,\" Mr. Hennibul said, \"do both with the Speaker. By\\r\\nthe bye, did you know that they are going to make me a judge?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard that your friends wanted to get rid of you!\" Arranmore\\r\\nanswered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To make yourself obnoxious--thoroughly obnoxious,\" Mr. Hennibul\\r\\nmurmured, \"is the sure road to advancement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s right, give me a few tips,\" Lord Arranmore begged, sipping his\\r\\nwine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear fellow, I don\\'t know what you\\'re going in for yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neither do I. What about the stage? I used to be rather good at\\r\\nprivate theatricals. Elderly Wyndhamy parts, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hennibul shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twenty years too late,\" he declared. \"Even the suburbs turn up their\\r\\nnoses at a lord now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must do something,\" Arranmore declared, meditatively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t see the necessity,\" Hennibul remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore lifted his glass and looked thoughtfully at the wine for\\r\\na moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, well,\" he said, \"you were born lazy, and I was born restless. That\\r\\nis the reason you have done something, and I haven\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you want my advice--my serious advice,\" the K. C. said, quietly,\\r\\n\"you will make yourself a nuisance to that right woman, whoever she is,\\r\\nuntil she marries you--if only to get rid of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All sorts of things in the way,\" Lord Arranmore declared. \"You see, I\\r\\nwas married abroad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hennibul looked up quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite true, I assure you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is she alive?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No--but her son is.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Great Heavens. Why, he\\'s Lord Kingston?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course he is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How old is he?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twenty-eight--or somewhere thereabouts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is he doing? Where is he? Why don\\'t we know him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He doesn\\'t approve of me,\" Lord Arranmore said. \"Fact, really! We are\\r\\nscarcely on speaking terms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Says I deserted his mother. So I did! Played the blackguard\\r\\naltogether. Left \\'em both to starve, or next door to it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hennibul fetched out his handkerchief and dabbed his forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are serious, Arranmore?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rather! You wouldn\\'t expect me to be frivolous on this hock.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That young man must be talked to,\" Mr. Hennibul declared. \"He ought\\r\\nto be filling his proper place in the world. It\\'s no use carrying on a\\r\\ngrudge against his own father. Let me have a try at him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\" Lord Arranmore said, quietly. \"I am obliged to you, Hennibul, but\\r\\nthe matter is one which does not admit of outside interference, however\\r\\nkindly. Besides, the boy is right. I wilfully deserted both him and\\r\\nhis mother, and she died during my absence. My life, whilst away from\\r\\nthem, was the sort one forgets--or tries to--and he knows about it.\\r\\nFurther, when I returned to England I was two years before I took the\\r\\ntrouble to go and see him. I merely alluded to these domestic matters\\r\\nthat you might not wholly misjudge the situation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hennibul went on with his supper in silence. Lord Arranmore.\\r\\nwhose appetite had soon failed him, leaned back in his chair and watched\\r\\nthe people in the further room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This rather puts me off politics,\" he remarked, after a while. \"I\\r\\ndon\\'t like the look of the people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you\\'ll get in for the select crushers,\" Mr. Hennibul said. \"This\\r\\nis a rank and file affair. You mustn\\'t judge by appearances. But why\\r\\nmust you specialize? Take my advice. Don\\'t go in specially for\\r\\npolitics, or society, or sport. Mix them all up. Be cosmopolitan and\\r\\ncommonplace.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, Hennibul, you are a genius,\" Arranmore declared, \"and\\r\\nyonder goes my good fairy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sprang up and disappeared into the further room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Caroom,\" he exclaimed, bending over her shoulder. \"I never\\r\\nsuspected it of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe started slightly--she was silent perhaps for the fraction of a\\r\\nsecond. Then she looked up with a bright smile, meeting him on his own\\r\\nground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But of you,\" she cried, \"it is incredible. Come at once and explain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\nBROOKS ENLISTS A RECRUIT\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks had found a small restaurant in the heart of fashionable London,\\r\\nwhere the appointments and decorations were French, and the waiters were\\r\\nnot disposed to patronize. Of the cooking neither he nor Mary Scott in\\r\\nthose days was a critic. Nevertheless she protested against the length\\r\\nof the dinner which he ordered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want an excuse,\" he declared, laying down the carte, \"for a good long\\r\\nchat. We shall be too late for the theatre, so we may as well resign\\r\\nourselves to an hour or so of one another\\'s society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A very apt excuse for unwarrantable greediness,\" she declared. \"Surely\\r\\nwe can talk without eating?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do not smoke, and you do not drink liqueurs,\" he remarked. \"Now I\\r\\nhave noticed that it is simply impossible for one to sit before an empty\\r\\ntable after dinner and not feel that one ought to go. Let the waiter\\r\\ntake your cape. You will find the room warm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you remember,\" she asked him, \"the first night we dined together?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her with twinkling eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rather! It was my introduction to your uncle\\'s household. Selina sat\\r\\non my left, and Louise on my right. You sat opposite, tired and\\r\\ndisagreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was tired--and I am always disagreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have noticed it,\" he agreed, equably. \"I hope you like oysters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If Selina were to see us now,\" she remarked, with a sudden humorous\\r\\nsmile, \"how shocked she would be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a little far-away world it seems down there,\" he said\\r\\nthoughtfully. \"After all, I am glad that I have not to live in\\r\\nMedchester all my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have been there this afternoon, haven\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. Henslow is giving us a lot of trouble. I am afraid we shall lose\\r\\nthe seat next election.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you mind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not much. I am no party politician. I want to see Medchester\\r\\nrepresented by a man who will go there with a sense of political\\r\\nproportion, and I don\\'t care whether he calls himself Liberal, or\\r\\nRadical, or Conservative, or Unionist.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please explain what you mean by that,\" she begged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, yes. I mean a man who will understand how enormously more\\r\\nimportant is the welfare of our own people, the people of whom we are\\r\\nmaking slaves, than this feverish Imperialism and war cant. Mind, I\\r\\nthink our patriotism should be a thing wholly understood. It needn\\'t be\\r\\ntalked about. It makes showy fireworks for the platform, but it\\'s all\\r\\nunnecessary and to my mind very undignified. If only people would take\\r\\nthat for granted and go on to something worth while.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are things any better in Medchester just now?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the surface, yes, but on the surface only. More factories are\\r\\nrunning half-time, but after all what does that mean? It\\'s slow\\r\\nstarvation. A man can\\'t live and keep a family on fifteen shillings a\\r\\nweek, even if his wife earns a little. He can\\'t do it in a dignified\\r\\nmanner, and with cleanliness and health. That is what he has a right\\r\\nto. That is what the next generation will demand. He should have room\\r\\nto expand. Cleanliness, air, fresh food. Every man and woman who is\\r\\nborn into the world has a God-given right to these, and there are\\r\\nmillions in Medchester, Manchester, and all the great cities who are\\r\\ndenied all three.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So all Henslow\\'s great schemes, his Royal Commissions, his Protection\\r\\nDuties, his great Housing Bill, have come to nothing then?\" she\\r\\nremarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To less than nothing,\" he answered, gloomily. \"The man was a fraud.\\r\\nHe is not worth attempting to bully. He is a puppet politician of a\\r\\ntype that ought to have been dead and buried generations ago. Enoch\\r\\nStone is our only hope in the House now. He is a strong man, and he\\r\\nhas hold of the truth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have they decided upon Henslow\\'s successor?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked up at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard from uncle this morning,\" she said, smiling meaningly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it was mentioned,\" he said, \"but I would not hear of it. I am\\r\\naltogether too young and inexperienced. I want to live with the people\\r\\nfor a year or two first. That is why I am glad to get to London.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With the people?\" she asked, \"in Jermyn Street?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed good-humouredly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have also lodgings in the Bethnal Green Road,\" he said. \"I took\\r\\npossession of them last week.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anywhere near Merry\\'s Corner?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you know about Merry\\'s Corner?\" he exclaimed, with uplifted\\r\\neyebrows. \"Yes, my rooms are nearly opposite, at the corner of the next\\r\\nstreet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve been down there once or twice lately,\" she said. \"There\\'s a\\r\\nmission-hall just there, and a girl named Kate Stuart gave me a letter\\r\\nto go three times a week.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know the place. Week-night services and hymn-singing and preaching.\\r\\nA cold, desolate affair altogether. I\\'m thankful I went in there,\\r\\nthough, for it\\'s given me an idea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYes?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m going to start a mission myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On a new principle. The first thing will be that there will be no\\r\\nreligious services whatever. I won\\'t have a clergyman connected with\\r\\nit. It will be intended solely for the benefit of the people from a\\r\\ntemporal point of view.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are going a long way,\" she said. \"What about Sundays?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There will be a very short service for the mission helpers only. No\\r\\none will be asked from outside at all. If they come it will be as a\\r\\nfavour. Directly it is over the usual week-day procedure will go on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what is that to be?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks smiled a little doubtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I\\'ve got the main idea in my head, but all the details\\r\\nwant thinking out. I want the place to be a sort of help bureau, to\\r\\ngive the people living in a certain street or couple of streets\\r\\nsomewhere to go for advice and help in cases of emergency. There will\\r\\nbe no money given away, under any consideration--only food, clothing,\\r\\nand, if they are asked for, books. I shall have half-a-dozen bathrooms,\\r\\nand the people who come regularly for advice and help will have to use\\r\\nthem and to keep their houses clean. There will be no distinction as to\\r\\ncharacter. We shall help the drunkards and the very worst of them just\\r\\nthe same as the others if they apply. If we get enough helpers there\\r\\nwill be plenty of branches we can open. I should like to have a\\r\\nchildren\\'s branch, for instance--one or two women will take the children\\r\\nof the neighbourhood in hand and bathe them every day. As we get to\\r\\nknow the people better and appreciate their special needs other things\\r\\nwill suggest themselves. But I want them to feel that they have some\\r\\nplace to fail back upon. We shall be frightfully humbugged, robbed,\\r\\ncheated, and deceived--at first. I fancy that after a time that will\\r\\nwear itself out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a fascinating idea,\" she said, thoughtfully, \"but to carry it out\\r\\nin any way thoroughly you want a great many helpers and a great deal of\\r\\nmoney.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have enough to start it,\" he said, \"and when it is really going and\\r\\nimproving itself I shall go out and ask for subscriptions-big ones, you\\r\\nknow, from the right sort of people. You can always get money if you\\r\\ncan show that it is to be well spent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what about the helpers?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I know of a few,\" he said, \"who I think would come in, and there\\r\\nis one to whom I would have to pay a small salary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could come in the afternoons,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Capital! But are you sure,\" he said, after a moment\\'s hesitation,\\r\\n\"that it is quite fair to yourself?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I can manage with my morning\\'s salary,\" she answered, laughing. \"I\\r\\nshan\\'t starve. Besides, I can always burn a little midnight oil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA waiter stood at their table for a moment, deftly carving some new\\r\\ndish, and Brooks, leaning back in his chair, glanced critically at his\\r\\ncompanion. In his judgment she represented something in womankind\\r\\nessentially of the durable type. He appreciated her good looks, the air\\r\\nwith which she wore her simple clothes, her large full eyes, her wide,\\r\\ngently-humorous mouth, and the hair parted in the middle, and rippling\\r\\naway towards her ears. A frank companionable woman, whose eyes had\\r\\nnever failed to look into his, in whom he had never at any time seen a\\r\\nsingle shadow of embarrassment. It occurred to him just at that moment\\r\\nthat never since he had known her had he seen her interested to the\\r\\nslightest degree in any man. He looked back at her thoughtfully. She\\r\\nwas young, good-looking, too catholic in her views of life and its\\r\\npossibilities to refuse in any way to recognize its inevitable\\r\\ntendencies. Yet he told himself complacently as he sipped his wine and\\r\\nwatched her gazing with amused interest at the little groups of people\\r\\nabout the place, that there must be in her composition a lack of\\r\\nsentiment. Never for a second in their intercourse had she varied from\\r\\nher usual good-natured cheerfulness. If there had been a shadow she had\\r\\nbrushed it away ruthlessly. Even on that terrible afternoon at Enton\\r\\nshe had sat in the cab white and silent--she had appealed to him in no\\r\\nway for sympathy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe waiter retreated with a bow. She shot a swift glance across at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I object to being scrutinized,\" she declared. \"Is it the plainness of\\r\\nmy hat or the depth of my wrinkles to which you object?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Object!\" he repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. You were looking for something which you did not find. You were\\r\\ndistinctly disappointed. Don\\'t deny it. It isn\\'t worth while.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I won\\'t plead guilty to the disappointment,\" he answered, \"but I\\'ll\\r\\ntell you the truth. I was thinking what a delightfully companionable\\r\\ngirl you were, and yet how different from any other girl I have ever met\\r\\nin my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That sounds hackneyed--the latter part of it,\" she remarked, \"but in my\\r\\ncase I see that it is not intended to be a compliment. What do I lack\\r\\nthat other girls have?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are putting me in a tight corner,\" he declared. \"It isn\\'t that you\\r\\nlack anything, but nearly all the girls one meets some time or other\\r\\nseem to expect from one nice little speeches or compliments, just a\\r\\nlittle sentiment now and then. Now you seem so entirely superior to\\r\\nthat sort of thing altogether. It is a ridiculously lame explanation.\\r\\nThe thing\\'s in my head all right, but I can\\'t get it out. I can only\\r\\nexpress it when I say that you are the only girl I have ever known, or\\r\\nknown of, in my life with whom sex would never interfere with\\r\\ncompanionship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stirred her coffee absently. At first he thought that she might be\\r\\noffended, for she did not look up for several moments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m afraid I failed altogether to make you understand what I meant,\" he\\r\\nsaid, humbly. \"It is the result of an attempt at too great candour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she looked up and smiled at him graciously enough, though it seemed\\r\\nto him that she was a little pale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure you were delightfully lucid,\" she said. \"I quite understood,\\r\\nand on the whole I think I agree with you. I don\\'t think that the\\r\\nsentimental side of me has been properly developed. By the bye, you\\r\\nwere going to tell me about that pretty girl I saw at Enton--Lady\\r\\nCaroom\\'s daughter, wasn\\'t she?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis face lit up--she saw his thoughts go flitting away, and the corner\\r\\nof his lips curl in a retrospective smile of pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sybil Caroom,\" he said, softly. \"She is a very charming girl. You\\r\\nwould like her, I am sure. Of course she\\'s been brought up in rather a\\r\\nfrivolous world, but she\\'s quite unspoilt, very sympathetic, and very\\r\\nintelligent. Isn\\'t that a good character?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very,\" she answered, with a suspicion of dryness in her tone. \"Is this\\r\\nparagon engaged to be married yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her, keenly surprised by the infusion of something foreign\\r\\nin her tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--I think not,\" he answered. \"I should like you to meet her very\\r\\nmuch. She will be coming to London soon, and I know that she will be\\r\\ninterested in our new scheme if it comes to anything. We will take her\\r\\ndown and give her a few practical lessons in philanthropy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will she be interested?\" Mary asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Immensely,\" he answered, with confidence. \"Lady Caroom is an awfully\\r\\ngood sort, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary remembered the well-bred insolence of Lady Caroom\\'s stare, the\\r\\ncontemplative incredulity which found militant expression in her\\r\\nbeautiful eyes and shapely curving lips, and for a moment half closed\\r\\nher eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, well,\" she said, \"that afternoon was rather a terrible one to me.\\r\\nLet us talk of something else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was profuse at once in apologies for his own thoughtlessness. But\\r\\nshe checked him almost at the outset.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is I who am to blame for an unusual weakness,\" she said. \"Let us\\r\\nboth forget it. And don\\'t you find this place hot? Let us get outside\\r\\nand walk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey found a soft misty rain falling. The commissionaire called a\\r\\nhansom. She moved her skirts to make room for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am going down to Stepney to see a man who I think will be interested\\r\\nin my scheme,\" he said. \"When may I come down again and have tea with\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Any afternoon, if you will drop me a line the night before,\" she said,\\r\\n\"but I am not very likely to be out, in any case. Thank you so much for\\r\\nmy dinner. My aunt seemed to think that I was coming to London to\\r\\nstarve. I think I feel fairly safe this evening, at any rate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cab drove off, skirting the gaily-lit crescent of Regent Street.\\r\\nThe smile almost at once died away from her lips. She leaned forward\\r\\nand looked at herself in one of the oblong mirrors. Her face was almost\\r\\ncolourless, the skin seemed drawn closely round her eyes, giving her\\r\\nalmost a strained look. For the rest, her hair, smoothly brushed away\\r\\nfrom her face, was in perfect order, her prim little hat was at exactly\\r\\nthe right angle, her little white tie alone relieved the sombreness of\\r\\nher black jacket. She sighed and suddenly felt a moistening of her hot\\r\\neyes. She leaned far back into the corner of the cab.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\nKINGSTON BROOKS, PHILANTHROPIST\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is my deliberate intention,\" Lord Arranmore said, leaning over\\r\\ntowards her from his low chair, \"to make myself a nuisance to you.\" Lady\\r\\nCaroom smiled at him thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you for the warning,\" she said, \"but I can take care of myself.\\r\\nI do not feel even obliged to deny myself the pleasure of your society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, you won\\'t do that,\" he remarked. \"You see, so many people bore\\r\\nyou, and I don\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is true,\" she admitted. \"You pay me nothing but unspoken\\r\\ncompliments, and you devote a considerable amount of ingenuity to\\r\\nconceal the real meaning of everything you say. Now some people might\\r\\nnot like that. I adore it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Catherine, will you marry me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not! I\\'m much too busy looking after Sybil, and in any case\\r\\nyou\\'ve had your answer, my friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will marry me,\" he said, deliberately, \"in less than two\\r\\nyears--perhaps in less than one. Why can\\'t you make your mind up to\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know why, Arranmore,\" she said, quietly. \"If you were the man I\\r\\nremember many years ago, the man I have wasted many hours of my life\\r\\nthinking about, I would not hesitate for a moment. I loved that man,\\r\\nand I have always loved him. But, Arranmore, I cannot recognize him in\\r\\nyou. If these terrible things which you have suffered, these follies\\r\\nwhich you have committed, have withered you up so that there remains no\\r\\ntrace of the man I once cared for, do you blame me for refusing you? I\\r\\nwill not marry a stranger, Arranmore, and I not only don\\'t know you, but\\r\\nI am a little afraid of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" he said, softly. \"I believe that the only\\r\\nthing I have carried with me from the beginning, and shall have with me\\r\\nto the end, is my love for you. Nothing else has survived.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eyes filled with tears. She leaned over to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear friend,\" she said, \"listen! At least I will promise you this. If\\r\\never I should see the least little impulse or action which seems to me\\r\\nto come from the Philip I once knew, and not Lord Arranmore, anything\\r\\nwhich will convince me that some part, however slight, of the old has\\r\\nsurvived, I will come to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You alone,\" he said, \"might work such a miracle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then come and see me often,\" she said, with a brilliant smile, \"and I\\r\\nwill try.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe moved his chair a little nearer to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You encourage me to hope,\" he said. \"I remember that one night in the\\r\\nconservatory I was presumptuous enough--to take your hand. History\\r\\nrepeats itself, you see, and I claim the prize, for I have fulfilled the\\r\\ncondition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe drew her hand away firmly, but without undue haste.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you are going to be frivolous,\" she said, \"I will have all the\\r\\ncallers shown in. You know very well that that is not what I mean.\\r\\nThere must be some unpremeditated action, some impulse which comes from\\r\\nyour own heart. Frankly, Arranmore, there are times now when I am\\r\\nafraid of you. You seem to have no heart--to be absolutely devoid of\\r\\nfeeling, to be cold and calculating even in your slightest actions.\\r\\nThere, now I have told you just what I feel sometimes, and it doesn\\'t\\r\\nsound nice, does it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It sounds very true,\" he said, wearily. \"Will you tell me where I can\\r\\nbuy a new heart and a fresh set of impulses, even a disposition,\\r\\nperhaps? I\\'d be a customer. I\\'m willing enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind that,\" she said, softly. \"After all, I have a certain\\r\\namount of faith. A miracle may happen at any moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil came in, dressed in a fascinating short skirt and a toque. Her\\r\\nmaid on the threshold was carrying a small green baize box.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am going to Prince\\'s, mother, just for an hour, with Mrs.\\r\\nHuntingdon. How do you do, Lord Arranmore? You\\'ll keep mother from\\r\\nbeing dull, won\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is your mother,\" he said, \"who is making me dull.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor old mummy,\" Sybil declared, cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind. Her bark\\'s a good deal worse than her bite. Good-bye,\\r\\nboth of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore rose and closed the door after her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sybil is a remarkably handsome young woman,\" he said. \"Any signs of\\r\\nher getting married yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! Arranmore, that reminds me, what has become of--Mr. Brooks?\" Lord\\r\\nArranmore smiled a little bitterly. \"He is in London.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never seen him, you must remember, since that evening. Is he\\r\\nstill--unforgiving?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes! He refuses to be acknowledged. He is taking the bare income\\r\\nwhich is his by law--it comes from a settlement to the eldest son--and\\r\\nhe is studying practical philanthropy in the slums.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry,\" she said. \"I like him, and he would be a companion for\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s not to be blamed,\" Lord Arranmore said. \"From his point of view I\\r\\nhave been the most scandalous parent upon this earth.\" Lady Caroom\\r\\nsighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know,\" she said, \"that he and Sybil were very friendly?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I noticed it,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has asked about him once or twice since we got back to town, and\\r\\nwhen she reads about the starting of this new work of his at Stepney she\\r\\nwill certainly write to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean that she has sent Sydney to the right-about this time in earnest.\\r\\nShe is a queer girl, reticent in a way, although she seems such a\\r\\nchatterbox, and I am sure she thinks about him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore laughed a little hardly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I am the last person to be consulted about anything of\\r\\nthis sort. If he keeps up his present attitude and declines to receive\\r\\nanything from me, his income until my death will be only two or three\\r\\nthousand a year. He might marry on that down in Stepney, but not in\\r\\nthis part of the world.\\'\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sybil has nine hundred a year,\" Lady Caroom said, \"but it would not be\\r\\na matter of money at all. I should not allow Sybil to marry any one\\r\\nconcerning whose position in the world there was the least mystery.\\r\\nShe might marry Lord Kingston of Ross, but never Mr. Kingston Brooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has--Mr. Brooks given any special signs of devotion?\" Lord Arranmore\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not since they were at Enton. I dare say he has never even thought of\\r\\nher since. Still, it was a contingency which occurred to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is a young man of excellent principles,\" Lord Arranmore said, dryly,\\r\\n\"taking life as seriously as you please, and I should imagine is too\\r\\nwell balanced to make anything but a very safe husband. If he comes to\\r\\nme, if he will accept it without coming to me even, he can have another\\r\\nten thousand a year and Enton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are generous,\" she murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Generous! My houses and my money are a weariness to me. I cannot live\\r\\nin the former, and I cannot spend the latter. I am a man really of\\r\\nsimple tastes. Besides, there is no glory now in spending money. One\\r\\ncan so easily be outdone by one\\'s grocer, or one of those marvellous\\r\\nAmericans.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet I thought I read of you last week as giving nine hundred pounds for\\r\\nsome unknown tapestry at Christie\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that is not extravagance,\" he protested. \"That is not even\\r\\nspending money. It is exchanging one investment for another. The\\r\\npurple colouring of that tapestry is marvellous. The next generation\\r\\nwill esteem it priceless.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must go?\" she asked, for he had risen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have stayed long enough,\" he answered. \"In another five minutes you\\r\\nwill yawn, and mine would have been a wasted visit. I should like to\\r\\ntime my visits always so that the five minutes which I might have stayed\\r\\nseem to you the most desirable five minutes of the whole time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are an epicurean and a schemer,\" she declared. \"I am afraid of\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n              *     *     *     *     *\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bought an evening paper on his way to St. James\\'s Square, and\\r\\nleaning back in his brougham, glanced it carelessly through. Just as he\\r\\nwas throwing it aside a small paragraph at the bottom of the page caught\\r\\nhis attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nA NOVEL PHILANTHROPIC DEPARTURE.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FIRST BUREAU OPENED TO-DAY.\\r\\n\\r\\nINTERVIEW WITH MR. KINGSTON BROOKS.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe folded the paper out, and read through every line carefully. A few\\r\\nminutes after his arrival home he re-issued from the house in a bowler\\r\\nhat and a long, loose overcoat. He took the Metropolitan and an omnibus\\r\\nto Stepney, and read the paragraph through again. Soon he found himself\\r\\nopposite the address given.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe recognized it with a little start. It had once been a mission hall,\\r\\nthen a furniture shop, and later on had been empty for years. It was\\r\\nbrilliantly lit up, and he pressed forward and peered through the\\r\\nwindow. Inside the place was packed. Brooks and a dozen or so others\\r\\nwere sitting on a sort of slightly-raised platform at the end of the\\r\\nroom, with a desk in front of each of them. Lord Arranmore pulled his\\r\\nhat over his eyes and forced his way just inside. Almost as he entered\\r\\nBrooks rose to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here,\" he said, \"you all come up asking the same question and\\r\\nwasting my time answering you all severally. You want to know what this\\r\\nplace means. Well, if you\\'ll stay just where you are for a minute, I\\'ll\\r\\ntell you all together, and save time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hear, hear, guv\\'nor,\" said a bibulous old costermonger, encouragingly.\\r\\n\"Let\\'s hear all about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So you shall,\" Brooks said. \"Now listen. I dare say there are a good\\r\\nmany of you who go up in the West End sometimes, and see those big\\r\\nhouses and the way people spend their money there, who come back to your\\r\\nown houses here, and think that things aren\\'t exactly dealt out square.\\r\\nIsn\\'t that so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a hearty and unanimous assent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" Brooks continued, \"it may surprise you to hear that a few of us\\r\\nwho have a little money up there have come to the same conclusion. We\\'d\\r\\nlike to do our little bit towards squaring things up.  It may not be\\r\\nmuch, but lots more may come of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA modified but a fairly cordial assent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We haven\\'t money to give away--not much of it, at any rate,\" Brooks\\r\\ncontinued.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More bloomin\\' tracks,\" the costermonger interrupted, and spat upon the\\r\\nfloor. \"Fair sickens me, it does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As for tracts,\" Brooks continued, calmly, \"I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever read\\r\\none in my life, and I don\\'t want to. We haven\\'t such a thing in the\\r\\nplace, and I shouldn\\'t know where to go for them, and though that\\r\\ngentleman down there with a herring sticking out of his pocket seems to\\r\\nhave done himself pretty well already, I\\'d rather stand him a glass of\\r\\nbeer than offer him such a thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA roar of laughter, during which a wag in the crowd quietly picked the\\r\\ncostermonger\\'s pocket of the fish with a deftness born of much practice,\\r\\nand sent it flying over the room. It was promptly returned, and found a\\r\\ndevious way back to its owner in a somewhat dusty and mauled condition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is just one thing we have to ask for and insist upon,\" Brooks\\r\\ncontinued. \"When you come to us for help, tell us the truth. If you\\'ve\\r\\nbeen drunk all the week and haven\\'t earned any money, well, we may help\\r\\nyou out with a Sunday dinner. If you\\'ve been in prison and won\\'t mind\\r\\nowning up to it, we shan\\'t send you away for that reason. We want your\\r\\nwomen to come and bring us your children, that we can have a look at\\r\\nthem, tell us how much you all make a week between you, and what you\\r\\nneed most to make you a bit more comfortable. And we want your husbands\\r\\nto come and tell us where they work, and what rent they pay, and if\\r\\nthey haven\\'t any work, and can\\'t get it, we\\'ll see what we can do. I\\r\\ntell you I don\\'t care to start with whether you\\'re sober and\\r\\nindustrious, or idle, or drunkards. We\\'ll give any one a leg-up if we\\r\\ncan. I don\\'t say we shall keep that up always, because of course we\\r\\nshan\\'t. But we\\'ll give any one a fair chance. Now do you want to ask\\r\\nany questions?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA pallid but truculent-looking young man pushed himself to the front.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Ere, guv\\'nor!\" he said. \"Supposing yer was to stand me a coat--I\\r\\nain\\'t \\'ad one for two months--should I \\'ave to come \\'ere on a Sunday and\\r\\nsing bloomin\\' hymns?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you did,\" Brooks answered him, \"you\\'d do it by yourself, and you\\'d\\r\\nstand a fair chance of being run out. There\\'s going to be no preaching\\r\\nor hymn-singing here. Those sorts of things are very well in their way,\\r\\nbut they\\'ve nothing to do with this show. I\\'m not sure whether we shall\\r\\nopen on Sundays or not. If we do it will be only for the ordinary\\r\\nbusiness. Now let\\'s get to work.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sounds a bit of orl right, and no mistake,\" the young man remarked,\\r\\nturning round to the crowd. \"I\\'m going to stop and \\'ave a go for that\\r\\ncoat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA young man in a bright scarlet jersey pushed himself to the front,\\r\\nfollowed by a little volley of chaff, more or less good-natured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s Salvation Joe wants a new trombone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Christian Sall\\'s blown a hole in the old one, eh, Joe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBreathless he reached Brooks\\' side. The sweat stood out in beads upon\\r\\nhis forehead. He seemed not to hear a word that was said amongst the\\r\\ncrowd. Brooks smiled at him good-humouredly. \"Well, sir,\" he said,\\r\\n\"what can I do for you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I happened in, sir, out of curiosity,\" the young man said, in a strange\\r\\nnasal twang, the heritage of years of outdoor preaching; \"I hoped to\\r\\nhear of one more good work begun in this den of iniquity and to clasp\\r\\nhands with another brother in God.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Glad to see you,\" Brooks said. \"You\\'ll remember we\\'re busy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The message of God,\" the young man answered, \"must be spoken at all\\r\\ntimes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, chuck \\'im out!\" cried the disgusted costermonger, spitting upon\\r\\nthe floor. \"That sort o\\' stuff fair sickens me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man continued as though he had not heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such charity as you are offering,\" he cried, \"is corruption. You are\\r\\ngoing to dispense things for their carnal welfare, and you do nothing\\r\\nfor their immortal souls. You will not let them even shout their thanks\\r\\nto God. You will fill their stomachs and leave their souls hungry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe costermonger waved a wonderful red handkerchief, and spat once more\\r\\non the floor. Brooks laid his hand upon the young man\\'s shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, my young friend,\" he said, \"you\\'re talking rot. Men and\\r\\nwomen who live down here in wretchedness, and who are fighting every\\r\\nmoment of their time to hang on to life, don\\'t want to be talked to\\r\\nabout their souls. They need a leg-up in the world, and we\\'ve come to\\r\\ntry and give it to them. We\\'re here as friends, not preachers. We\\'ll\\r\\nleave you to look after their souls. You people who\\'ve tried to make\\r\\nyour religion the pill to go with your charity have done more harm in\\r\\nthe world than you know of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man was on fire to speak, but he had no chance. They hustled\\r\\nhim out good-naturedly except that the costermonger, running him down\\r\\nthe room, took his cap from his head and sent it spinning across the\\r\\nroad. Lord Arranmore left the hall at the same time, and turned\\r\\nhomewards, walking like a man in a dream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\nBROOKS AND HIS MISSIONS\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now then, please,\" Brooks said, dipping his pen in the ink.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lady of ample proportions, who had been standing since the\\r\\ncommencement of the proceedings with her hand tightly grasping the leg\\r\\nof Brooks\\' table, gave a final shove of discomfiture to a meek-faced\\r\\ngirl whom she had suspected of an attempt to supersede her, and\\r\\npresented herself before the desk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m first,\" she declared, firmly; \"been \\'ere for four mortal hours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is your name, please?\" Brooks asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Robert Jones, No. 4, St. Mary\\'s Court, down Fennell\\r\\nStreet--leastways you go that way from \\'ere. I\\'m a widow woman with\\r\\nfour children, and lost me husband on the railway. What I wants is a\\r\\nsuit of clothes for my Tommy, he\\'s five-and-\\'arf, and stout for his\\r\\nyears, and a pair of boots for Selina Ann. And I\\'m not a saying,\" she\\r\\ncontinued, blandly, \"as me having waited \\'ere so long, and this being a\\r\\nsort of opening ceremony, as a pound of tea for myself wouldn\\'t be a\\r\\nwelcome and reasonable gift. And if the suit,\" she concluded,\\r\\nbreathlessly, \"has double-seated breeches so much the better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks maintained the most perfect composure, although conscious of a\\r\\nsuppressed titter from behind. He commenced to write rapidly in his\\r\\nbook, and Mrs. Jones, drawing her shawl about her, looked around\\r\\ncomplacently. Suddenly she caught the ripple of mirth, which some of\\r\\nBrooks\\' helpers were powerless to control. Her face darkened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which is little enough to ask for,\" she declared, truculently,\\r\\n\"considering as it\\'s four mortal hours since I first laid hold of the\\r\\nleg of that table, and neither bite nor sup have I had since, it not\\r\\nbeing my habit,\" she continued, slowly, and staring intently at the hang\\r\\nof her neighbour\\'s skirt, \"to carry bottles in my pocket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks looked up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Mrs. Jones,\" he said. \"I have entered your name and\\r\\naddress, and I hope we shall see you again soon. This young lady,\" he\\r\\nindicated Mary, \"will take you over to our clothes department, and if we\\r\\nhaven\\'t anything to fit Tommy you must come again on Wednesday, when we\\r\\nshall have a larger supply.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll take the nearest you\\'ve got to-day,\" she decided, promptly. \"Wot\\r\\nabout the tea?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall be glad to ask you to accept a small packet,\" Brooks answered.\\r\\n\"By the bye, have you a pension from the railway company?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not a penny, sir,\" she declared, \"and a burning shame it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must see into it,\" Brooks said. \"You see that gentleman behind me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Him with the squint?\" she asked, doubtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks bent over his book.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Fellows, his name is,\" he said. \"He is one of our helpers here,\\r\\nand he is a lawyer. You can tell him all about it, and if we think you\\r\\nhave a claim we will try and see what we can do for you. Now, if you\\r\\nplease, we must get on. Come in any time, Mrs. Jones, and talk to us.\\r\\nSome one is, always here. What is your name, please?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Amy Hardinge!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a howl of derision from the rear. The girl, pallid, with\\r\\nlarge dark eyes, a somewhat tawdry hat and torn skirt, turned angrily\\r\\naround.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who yer shouting at, eh? There ain\\'t so many of yer as knows yer own\\r\\nnames, I dir say, and \\'Ardinge\\'s as good as any other. Leave a body be,\\r\\nwon\\'t yer?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned round to Brooks, and disclosed a most alarming rent in her\\r\\ngown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look \\'ere, guv\\'nor,\" she said, \"that\\'s my name, and I \\'as a back room\\r\\nbehind old Connel\\'s fish-shop next door but one to \\'ere. If yer want to\\r\\ngive away things to them as wants \\'em, wot price a new skirt \\'ere, eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA woman from the rear leaned over to Brooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The \\'ussy,\" she said. \"Don\\'t you take no notice of \\'er, sir. We all\\r\\nknows \\'er--and precious little good there is ter know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Hardinge was not unreasonably annoyed. She turned round with\\r\\nflashing eyes and belligerent attitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who the \\'ell asked you anything?\" she exclaimed. \"Can\\'t yer keep your\\r\\nbloomin\\' mouths closed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA pale-faced little man pushed his way through the throng. He was\\r\\ndressed in a semi-clerical garb, and he tapped Brooks on the shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you favour me with one moment\\'s private conversation, sir?\" he\\r\\nsaid. \"My name is John Deeling, and I am a minister of the Gospel. The\\r\\nMission House in Fennell Street is my special charge.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Glad to know you, Mr. Deeling,\" Brooks answered, \"but I can\\'t spare\\r\\nany time for private conversation now. Can\\'t you speak to me here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Deeling looked doubtfully at the girl who stood still before the\\r\\ndesk, silent, but breathing hard. A sullen shade had fallen upon her\\r\\nface. She looked like a creature at bay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is concerning-this unfortunate young person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can assure you,\" Brooks said, dipping his pen in the ink, \"that no\\r\\nrecommendation is necessary. I shall do what I can for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You misapprehend me, sir,\" Mr. Deeling said, with some solemnity. \"I\\r\\nregret to say that no recommendation is possible. That young person is\\r\\noutside the pale of all Christian help. I regret to speak so plainly\\r\\nbefore ladies, sir, but she is a notorious character, a hardened and\\r\\nincurable prostitute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks looked at him for a moment fixedly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did I understand you to say, sir, that you were a minister of the\\r\\nGospel?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly! I am well known in the neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then if you take my advice,\" Brooks said, sternly, \"you will take off\\r\\nthose garments and break stones upon the street. It is to help such\\r\\nunfortunate and cruelly ill-used young women as this that I and my\\r\\nfriends have come here. Be off, sir. Miss Hardinge, this young lady\\r\\nwill take you to our clothes store in the inner room there. I hope you\\r\\nwill permit us to be of some further use to you later on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl, half dazed, passed away. Mr. Deeling, his face red with\\r\\nanger, turned towards the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may call it a Christian deed, sir,\" he exclaimed, angrily, \"to\\r\\nencourage vice of the worst description. We shall see what the bishop,\\r\\nwhat the Press, have to say about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t care a snap of the fingers what you, or the bishop, or time\\r\\nPress have to say,\" Brooks rejoined, equably; \"but lest there should be\\r\\nthose here who agree with your point of view, let them hear this from me\\r\\nat once, to prevent misunderstanding. We are here to help to the best\\r\\nof our ability all who need help, whatsoever their characters. They are\\r\\nequally welcome to what we have to offer, whether they be thieves, or\\r\\nprostitutes, or drunkards, or respectable men and women. But if I were\\r\\nasked what really brought me here, for what class of people in the world\\r\\nmy sympathy and the sympathies of my friends have been most warmly\\r\\nkindled, I should say, for such as that young woman who has just\\r\\npresented herself here. If she asks for them, she will have from us\\r\\nfood and clothes and the use of our baths and reading-rooms whenever she\\r\\nchooses, and I will guarantee that not one of my women friends here who\\r\\ncome in contact with her will ask a single question as to her mode of\\r\\nlife, until she invites their confidence. If you think that she is\\r\\nresponsible for her present state, you and I differ--if you think that\\r\\none shadow of blame rests upon her, we differ again. And if there are\\r\\nany more like her in the room, let them come out, and they shall have\\r\\nall that they ask for, that it is within our power to give.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hear, hear, guv\\'nor!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s ginger for \\'im.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Out of this, old white choker. There\\'s beans for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey let him pass through. On the threshold he turned and faced Brooks\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At least,\" he said, \"I can promise you this. God\\'s blessing will never\\r\\nbe upon your work. I doubt whether you will be allowed to continue it\\r\\nin this Christian country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks rose to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Deeling,\" he said, \"you and your mission system of work amongst\\r\\nthe poor have been fighting a losing battle in this country for fifty\\r\\nyears and more. A Christian country you call it. Go outside in the\\r\\nstreets. Look north and south, east and west, look at the people, look\\r\\nat their children, look at their homes. Is there one shadow of\\r\\nimprovement in this labyrinth of horrors year by year, decade by decade?\\r\\nYou know in your heart that there is none. Therefore if new means be\\r\\nchosen, do not condemn them too rashly. Your mission houses, many of\\r\\nthem, have been nothing but breeding-places for hypocrisy. It is time\\r\\nthe old order was changed. Now, sir, you are next. What can we do for\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA weary-looking man with hollow eyes and nervously-twitching fingers\\r\\nfound himself pushed before the desk. He seemed at first embarrassed\\r\\nand half dazed. Brooks waited without any sign of impatience. When at\\r\\nlast he spoke, it was without the slightest trace of any Cockney accent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--I beg your pardon, sir! I ought not perhaps to intrude here, but I\\r\\ndon\\'t know who needs help more than I do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s orl right, sir,\" sung out the costermonger. \"He is a bit queer in\\r\\nthe \\'ead, but he\\'s a scholar, and fair on his uppers. Speak up, Joe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see, my friends are willing to give me a character, sir,\" the man\\r\\nremarked, with a ghost of a smile. \"My name is Edward Owston. I was\\r\\nclerk at a large drapery firm, Messrs. Appleby, Sons, and Dawson, in\\r\\nSt. Paul\\'s Churchyard, for fourteen years. I have a verified character\\r\\nfrom them. They were obliged to cult down their staff, owing to foreign\\r\\ncompetition, and--I have never succeeded--in obtaining another\\r\\nsituation. There is nothing against me, sir. I would have worked for\\r\\nfifteen shillings a week. I walked the streets till my boots were worn\\r\\nthrough and my clothes hung around me like rags. It was bad luck at\\r\\nfirst--afterwards it was my clothes. I have been selling matches for a\\r\\nmonth it has brought me in two shillings a week.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How old are you?\" Brooks asked. \"Thirty-four, sir.\" Brooks nearly\\r\\ndropped his pen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\" he exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thirty-four, sir. It is four years since I lost my situation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man\\'s hair was grey, a little stubbly grey beard was jutting out\\r\\nfrom his chin. His eyes were almost lost in deep hollows. Brooks felt\\r\\na lump in his throat, and for a moment pretended to be writing busily.\\r\\nThen he looked up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall give you a fresh start in life, Edward Owston,\" he said.\\r\\n\"Follow this gentleman at my left. He will find you clothes and food.\\r\\nTo-morrow you will go to a cottage which belongs to us at Hastings for\\r\\none month. Afterwards, if your story is true, we shall find you a\\r\\nsuitable situation--if it is partially true, we shall still find you\\r\\nsomething to do. If it is altogether false we cannot help you, for\\r\\nabsolute truth in answering our questions is the only condition we\\r\\nimpose.\" The man never uttered a word. He went out leaning upon the arm\\r\\nof one of Brooks\\' assistants. Another, who was a doctor, after a glance\\r\\ninto the man\\'s face, followed them. When he returned, after about\\r\\ntwenty minutes\\' absence, he leaned forward and whispered in Brooks\\' ear\\r\\n\"You\\'ll never have to find a situation for that poor fellow. A month\\'s\\r\\nabout all he\\'s good for.\" Brooks looked round shocked. \"What is\\r\\nit--drink?\" he asked. The doctor shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not a trace of it. Starvation and exhaustion. If I hadn\\'t been with\\r\\nhim just now he\\'d have been dead before this. He fainted away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks half closed his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is horrible!\" he murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe costermonger was next. Brooks looked around the room and at the\\r\\nclock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here,\" he said. \"If I sit here till tomorrow I can\\'t possibly\\r\\nattend to all of you. I tell you what I\\'ll do. If you others will give\\r\\nplace to those whose cases are really urgent, I\\'ll be here at seven\\r\\nto-morrow morning till seven at night, and the next day too, if\\r\\nnecessary. It\\'s no good deputing any one else to tell me, because\\r\\nhowever many branches we open--and I hope we shall open a great many--I\\r\\nmean to manage this one myself, and I must know you all personally.\\r\\nNow are you all agreeable?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am for one,\" declared the costermonger, moving away from before the\\r\\ndesk. \"I ain\\'t in no \\'urry. I\\'ve \\'ad a bit o\\' bad luck wi\\' my barrer,\\r\\nall owing to a plaguing drunken old omnibus-driver, and horl I want is a\\r\\nbit o\\' help towards the security. Josh Auk wants it before he\\'ll let me\\r\\nout a new one. Tomorrow\\'s horl right for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I expect we\\'ll manage that,\" Brooks remarked. \"Now where are the\\r\\nurgent cases?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne by one they were elbowed forward. Brooks\\' pen flew across the\\r\\npaper. It was midnight even then before they had finished. Brooks and\\r\\nMary Scott left together. They were both too exhausted for words.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they crossed the street Mary suddenly touched his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look!\" she whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\nA girl was leaning up against the wall, her face buried in her hands,\\r\\nsobbing bitterly. They both watched her for a moment. It was Amy\\r\\nHardinge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will go and speak to her,\" Mary whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks drew her away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not one word, even of advice,\" he said. \"Let us keep to our\\r\\nprinciples. The end will be surer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey turned the corner of the street. Above the shouting of an angry\\r\\nwoman and the crazy song of a drunken man the girl\\'s sobs still lingered\\r\\nin their ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. BULLSOM IS STAGGERED\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom looked up from his letters With an air of satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Company to dinner, Mrs. Bullsom!\" he declared. \"Some more of your\\r\\nsilly old directors, I suppose,\" said Selina, discontentedly. \"What a\\r\\nnuisance they are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom frowned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My silly old directors, as you call \\'em,\" he answered, \"may not be\\r\\nexactly up to your idea of refinement, but I wouldn\\'t call \\'em names if\\r\\nI were you. They\\'ve made me one of the richest men in Medchester.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A lot we get out of it,\" Louise grunted, discontentedly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You get as much as you deserve,\" Mr. Bullsom retorted. \"Besides,\\r\\nyou\\'re so plaguing impatient. You don\\'t hear your mother talk like\\r\\nthat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina whispered something under her breath which Mr. Bullsom, if he\\r\\nheard, chose to ignore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve explained to you all before,\" he continued, \"that up to the end of\\r\\nlast year we\\'ve been holding the entire property--over a million pounds\\'\\r\\nworth, between five of us. Our time\\'s come now. Now, look here--I\\'ll\\r\\nlisten to what you\\'ve got to say--all of you. Supposing I\\'ve made up my\\r\\nmind to launch out. How do you want to do it? You first, mother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bullsom looked worried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Peter,\" she said, \"I think we\\'re very comfortable as we are. A\\r\\nlarger household means more care, and a man-servant about the place is a\\r\\nthing I could never abide. If you felt like taking sittings at Mr.\\r\\nThompson\\'s as well as our own chapel, so that we could go there when we\\r\\nfelt we needed a change, I think I should like it sometimes. But it\\r\\nseems a waste of good money with Sundays only coming once in seven\\r\\ndays.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom shook with good-humoured laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mother, mother,\" he said, \"we shall never smarten you up, shall we,\\r\\ngirls? Now, what do you say, Selina?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like a country house quite ten on fifteen miles away from\\r\\nhere, lots of horses and carriages, and a house in town for the season,\"\\r\\nSelina declared, boldly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you, Louise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like what Selina has said.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom looked a little grave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The house in London,\" he said, \"you shall have, whether I buy it or\\r\\nonly hire it for a few months at a time. If we haven\\'t friends up\\r\\nthere, there are always the theatres and music-halls, and lots going on.\\r\\nBut a country house is a bit different. I thought of building a place\\r\\nup at Nicholson\\'s Corner, where the trains stop. The land belongs to\\r\\nme, and there\\'s room for the biggest house in Medchester.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina tossed her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course,\" she said, \"if we have to spend all our lives in this\\r\\nhateful suburb it doesn\\'t much matter whether you stay here on build\\r\\nanother house, no one will come to see us. We shall never get to know\\r\\nanybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And supposing you go out into the country,\" Mr. Bullsom argued. \"How\\r\\ndo you know that you will make friends there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"People must call,\" Selina answered, \"if you subscribe to the hounds,\\r\\nand you must get made a magistrate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have lived here for a good many years,\" Mr. Bullsom said, \"and\\r\\nthere are very superior people living almost at our doors whom even you\\r\\ngirls don\\'t know to bow to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina tossed her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Superior, you call them, do you? A silly stuck-up lot, I think. They\\r\\nform themselves into little sets, and if you don\\'t belong, they treat\\r\\nyou as though you had small-pox.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The men are all pleasant enough,\" Mr. Bullsom remarked. \"I meet them\\r\\nin the trains and in business, and they\\'re always glad enough to pass\\r\\nthe time o\\' day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, the men are all right,\" Selina answered. \"It\\'s easy enough to know\\r\\nthem. Mr. Wensome trod on my dress the other day, and apologized as\\r\\nthough he\\'d torn it off my back, and the next day he gave me his seat in\\r\\nthe car. I always acknowledge him, and he\\'s glad enough to come and\\r\\ntalk, but if his wife\\'s with him, she looks straight ahead as though\\r\\nevery one else in the car were mummies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom cut the end of a cigar thoughtfully, and motioned Louise to\\r\\nget him a light.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see, your mother and I are getting on in life,\" he said, \"and it\\'s\\r\\na great thing to ask us to settle down in a place where there\\'s no\\r\\nslipping off down to the club in the evening, and no chance of a friend\\r\\ndropping in for a chat. We\\'ve got to an age when we need some one to\\r\\ntalk to. I ain\\'t going to say that a big house in the country isn\\'t a\\r\\nnice thing to have, and the gardens and that would be first-class. But\\r\\nit\\'s a big move, and it ain\\'t to be decided about all in a hurry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, father, there\\'s the shooting,\" Selina exclaimed. \"You\\'re fond of\\r\\nthat, and men will go anywhere for really good shooting, and make their\\r\\nwives go, too. If you could get a place with plenty of it, and a\\r\\nfox-covert or two on the estate, I\\'m perfectly certain we should be all\\r\\nright.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom looked still a little doubtful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s all very well,\" he said, \"but I don\\'t want to bribe people into\\r\\nmy house with shooting and good cooking, and nursing their blooming\\r\\nfoxes. That ain\\'t my idea of making friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s only breaking the ice-just at first,\" Selina argued. \"Afterwards\\r\\nI\\'m sure you\\'d find them friendly enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you what I shall do,\" Mr. Bullsom said, deliberately; \"I shall\\r\\nconsult the friend I\\'ve got coming to dinner to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina smiled contemptuously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pshaw!\" she exclaimed. \"What do any of them know about such things?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t know who it is,\" Mr. Bullsom replied, mysteriously.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls turned towards him almost simultaneously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it Mr. Brooks?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom nodded. Selina flushed with pleasure and tried to look\\r\\nunconscious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only the day before yesterday,\" Mr. Bullsom said, \"as chairman of the\\r\\ncommittee, I had the pleasure of forwarding to Brooks a formal\\r\\ninvitation to become the parliamentary candidate for the borough. He\\r\\nwrites to me by return to say that he will be here this afternoon, as he\\r\\nwishes to see me personally.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must say he hasn\\'t lost much time,\" Louise remarked, smiling across\\r\\nat Selina.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom grunted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t see how he could do much less,\" he said. \"After all, though\\r\\nevery one admits that he\\'s a clever young chap and uncommonly\\r\\nconscientious, he\\'s not well known generally, and he hasn\\'t the position\\r\\nin the town or anywhere which people generally look for in a\\r\\nparliamentary candidate. I may tell you, girls, and you, mother, that\\r\\nhe was selected solely on my unqualified support and my casting vote.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope,\" Mrs. Bullsom said, \"that he will be properly grateful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sure it\\'s very good of you, pa,\" Selina declared, affably. She\\r\\nliked the idea of Brooks owing so much to her father.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s no young man,\" Mr. Bullsom said, \"whom I like so much or think\\r\\nso much of as Mr. Brooks. If I\\'d a son like that I\\'d be a proud man.\\r\\nAnd as we\\'re here all alone, just the family, as it were, I\\'ll go on to\\r\\nsay this,\" Mr. Bullsom continued, his right thumb finding its way to\\r\\nthe armhole of his waistcoat. \"I\\'m going to drop a hint at the first\\r\\nopportunity I get, quite casually, that whichever of you girls gets\\r\\nmarried first gets a cheque from me for one hundred thousand pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEven Selina was staggered. Mrs. Bullsom was positively frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bullsom!\" she said. \"Peter, you ain\\'t got as much as that? Don\\'t\\r\\ntell me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am worth to-day,\" Mr. Bullsom said, solemnly, \"at least five hundred\\r\\nthousand pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Peter,\" Mrs. Bullsom gasped, \"has it been come by honest?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom smiled in a superior way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I made it,\" he answered, \"by locking up forty thousand, more than half\\r\\nof what I was worth, for five years. But I knew what I was about, and\\r\\nso did the others. Mason made nearly as much as I did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina looked at her father with a new respect. He rose and brushed the\\r\\nashes of his cigar from his waistcoat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I\\'m off,\" he declared. \"Brooks and I will be back about seven, and\\r\\nI shall try and get him to sleep here. Fix yourselves up quiet and\\r\\nladylike, you girls. Good-bye, mother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n              *     *     *     *     *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have about an hour before dinner,\" Mr. Bullsom remarked, sinking\\r\\ninto his most comfortable chair and lighting a cigar. \"Just time for a\\r\\ncomfortable chat. You\\'ll smoke, Brooks, won\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks excused himself, and remained standing upon the hearthrug, his\\r\\nelbow upon the mantelpiece. He hated this explanation he had to make.\\r\\nHowever, it was no good in beating about the bush.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am going to surprise you very much, Mr. Bullsom,\" he began.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom took the cigar from his mouth and looked up with wide-open\\r\\neyes. He had been preparing graciously to wave away a torrent of\\r\\nthanks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am going to surprise you very much,\" Brooks repeated. \"I cannot\\r\\naccept this magnificent offer of yours. I cannot express my gratitude\\r\\nsufficiently to you, or to the committee. Nothing would have made me\\r\\nhappier than to have been able to accept it. But I am absolutely\\r\\npowerless.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t funk it?\" Mr. Bullsom asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I. The fact is, there are circumstances connected with myself which\\r\\nmake it inadvisable for me to seek any public position at present.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom\\'s first sensations of astonishment were augmented into\\r\\nstupefaction. He was scarcely capable of speech. He found himself\\r\\nwondering idly how heinous a crime a man must commit to be branded\\r\\nineligible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To explain this to you,\" Brooks continued, \"I am bound to tell you\\r\\nsomething which is only known to two people in the country. The Marquis\\r\\nof Arranmore is my father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom dropped his cigar from between his fingers, and it lay for\\r\\na moment smouldering upon the carpet. His face was a picture of blank\\r\\nand hopeless astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless my soul!\" he exclaimed, faintly. \"You mean that you--you,\\r\\nKingston Brooks, the lawyer, are Lord Arranmore\\'s son?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes! It\\'s not a pleasant story. My father deserted my mother when I\\r\\nwas a child, and she died in his absence. A few months ago, Lord\\r\\nArranmore, in a leisurely sort of way, thought well to find me out, and\\r\\nafter treating me as an acquaintance for some time--a sort of\\r\\nprobationary period, I suppose--he told me the truth. That is the\\r\\nreason of my resigning from the firm of Morrison and Brooks almost as\\r\\nsoon as the partnership deed was signed. I went to see Mr. Ascough and\\r\\ntold him about your offer, and he, of course, explained the position to\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\"--Mr. Bullsom paused as though striving to straighten out the\\r\\nmatter in his own mind, \"but if you are Lord Arranmore\\'s son there is no\\r\\nsecret about it, is there? Why do you still call yourself Mr. Brooks?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom, whose powers of observation were not remarkably acute,\\r\\nlooking steadily into his visitor\\'s face, saw there some signs of a\\r\\ncertain change which others had noticed and commented upon during the\\r\\nlast few months--a hardening of expression and a slight contraction of\\r\\nthe mouth. For Brooks had spent many sleepless nights pondering upon\\r\\nthis new problem which had come into his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not feel inclined,\" he said, quietly, \"for many reasons, to accept\\r\\nthe olive-branch which it has pleased my father to hold out to me after\\r\\nall these years. I have still some faint recollections of the close of\\r\\nmy mother\\'s life--hastened, I am sure, by anxiety and sorrow on his\\r\\naccount. I remember my own bringing up, the loneliness of it. I\\r\\nremember many things which Lord Arranmore would like me now to forget.\\r\\nThen, too, my father and I are as far apart as the poles. He has not\\r\\nthe least sympathy with my pursuits or the things which I find worth\\r\\ndoing in life. There are other reasons which I need not trouble you\\r\\nwith. It is sufficient that for the present I prefer to remain Mr.\\r\\nBrooks, and to lead my own life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But--you won\\'t be offended, but I want to understand. The thing seems\\r\\nsuch a muddle to me. You\\'ve given up your practice--how do you mean to\\r\\nlive?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is an income which comes to me from the Manor of Kingston,\"\\r\\nBrooks answered, \"settled on the eldest sons of the Arranmore peerage,\\r\\nwith which my father has nothing to do. This alone is comparative\\r\\nwealth, and there are accumulations also.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It don\\'t seem natural,\" Mr. Bullsom said. \"If you\\'ll excuse my saying\\r\\nso, it don\\'t sound like common-sense. You can live on what terms you\\r\\nplease with your father, but you ought to let people know who you are.\\r\\nGreat Scott,\" he added, with a little chuckle, \"what will Julia and the\\r\\ngirls say?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will understand, Mr. Bullsom,\" Brooks said, hastily, \"that I trust\\r\\nyou to preserve my confidence in this matter. I have told you because\\r\\nI wanted you to understand why I could not accept this invitation to\\r\\ncontest the borough, also because you were one of my best friends when I\\r\\nwas here. But you are the only person to whom I have told my secret.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom sighed. It would have been such a delightful disclosure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As you wish, of course,\" he said. \"But my it don\\'t seem possible!\\r\\nLord Arranmore\\'s son--the Marquis of Arranmore! Gee whiz!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some day, of course,\" Brooks said, \"it must come out. But I don\\'t want\\r\\nit to be yet awhile. If that clock is right hadn\\'t I better be going\\r\\nup-stairs?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you\\'ll come with me,\" he said, \"I\\'ll show you your room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\nGHOSTS\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks, relieved that his explanation with Mr. Bullsom was over, was\\r\\nsufficiently entertaining at dinner-time. He sat between Selina and\\r\\nLouise, and made himself agreeable to both. Mr. Bullsom for half the\\r\\ntime was curiously abstracted, and for the remainder almost boisterous.\\r\\nEvery now and then he found himself staring at Brooks as though at some\\r\\nnatural curiosity. His behaviour was so singular that Selina commented\\r\\nupon it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One would think, papa, that you and Mr. Brooks had been quarrelling,\"\\r\\nshe remarked, tartly. \"You seem quite odd to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom raised his glass. He had lately improved his cellar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Drink your health, Brooks,\" he said, looking towards him. \"We had an\\r\\ninteresting chat, but we didn\\'t get quarrelling, did we?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor are we ever likely to,\" Brooks answered, smiling. \"You know, Miss\\r\\nBullsom, your father was my first client of any importance, and I shan\\'t\\r\\nforget how glad I was to get his cheque.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m very pleased that he was useful to you,\" Selina answered,\\r\\nimpressively. \"Will you tell me something that we want to know very\\r\\nmuch?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you really not coming back to Medchester to live?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. I am settling down in London. I have found some work there I\\r\\nlike.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then are you the Mr. Brooks who has started what the Daily Courier\\r\\ncalls a \\'Whiteby\\'s Charity Scheme\\' in the East End?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite true, Miss Bullsom. And your cousin is helping me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina raised her eyebrows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me,\" she said, \"I had no idea that Many had time to spare for that\\r\\nsort of thing, had you, father?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Many can look after herself, and uncommonly well too,\" Mr. Bullsom\\r\\nanswered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She comes mostly in the evening,\" Brooks explained, \"but she is one of\\r\\nmy most useful helpers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must be so interesting to do good,\" Louise said, artlessly. \"After\\r\\ndinner, Mr. Brooks, will you tell us all about it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems so odd that you should care so much for that sort of thing,\"\\r\\nSelina remarked. \"As a rule it is the frumpy and uninteresting people\\r\\nwho go in for visiting the poor and doing good, isn\\'t it? You seem so\\r\\nyoung, and so--oh, I don\\'t think I\\'d better go on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please do,\" Brooks begged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you won\\'t think I was trying to flatter, will you, but I was\\r\\ngoing to say, and too clever for that sort of thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" he said, \"the reason that social reform is so urgently needed\\r\\nin so many ways is for that very reason, Miss Bullsom--that the wrong\\r\\nsort of person has been going in for it. Looking after the poor has\\r\\nmeant for most people handing out bits of charity on the toasting-fork\\r\\nof religion. And that sort of thing doesn\\'t tend to bridge over the\\r\\ngulf, does it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Toasting-fork!\" Selina giggled. \"How funny you are, Mr. Brooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Am I?\" he answered, good-humouredly. \"Now let me hear what you have\\r\\nbeen doing since I saw you in town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina was immediately grave--not to say scornful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Doing! What do you suppose there is to do here?\" she exclaimed,\\r\\nreproachfully. \"We\\'ve been sitting still waiting for something to\\r\\nhappen. But--have you said anything to Mr. Brooks yet, papa?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Haven\\'t had time,\" he answered. \"Brooks had so much to say to me. You\\r\\nknew all about our land company, Brooks, of course? You did a bit of\\r\\nconveyancing for us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I did,\" Brooks answered, \"and I told you from the first that\\r\\nyou were going to make a lot of money by it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom glanced around the room. The two maid-servants were at the\\r\\nsideboard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Guess how much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never knew your exact share,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s half a million,\" Mr. Bullsom said, pulling down his waistcoat,\\r\\nand squaring himself to the table. \"Not bad, eh, for a country spec?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s wonderful,\" Brooks admitted. \"I congratulate you heartily.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thanks,\" Mr. Bullsom answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We want papa to buy a house in the country, and go to town for the\\r\\nseason,\" Selina said. \"So long as we can afford it I am dying to get\\r\\nout of Medchester. It is absolutely the most commercial town I have\\r\\never been in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your father should stand for Parliament himself,\" Brooks suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is really possible that Mr. Bullsom, being a man governed entirely\\r\\nby one idea at a time, had never seriously contemplated the possibility\\r\\nof himself stepping outside the small arena of local politics. It is\\r\\ncertain at any rate that Brooks\\' words came to him as an inspiration.\\r\\nHe stared for a moment into his glass--then at Brooks. Finally he\\r\\nbanged the table with the flat of his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s an idea!\" he exclaimed. \"Why not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not, indeed?\" Brooks answered. \"You\\'d be a popular candidate for\\r\\nthe borough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m chairman of the committee,\" Mr. Bullsom declared; \"I\\'ll propose\\r\\nmyself. I\\'ve taken the chair at political dinners and meetings for the\\r\\nlast twenty years. I know the runs, and the people of Medchester know\\r\\nme. Why not, indeed? Mr. Brooks, sir, you\\'re a genius.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You \\'ave given him something to think about,\" Mrs. Bullsom murmured,\\r\\namiably. \"I\\'d be willing enough but for the late hours. They never did\\r\\nagree with Peter--did they? He\\'s always been such a one for his rest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom\\'s thumbs made their accustomed pilgrimage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the service of one\\'s country,\" he said, \"one should be prepared to\\r\\nmake sacrifices. The champagne, Amy. Besides, one can always sleep in\\r\\nthe morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina and Louise exchanged glances, and Selina, as the elder, gave the\\r\\nproject her languid approval.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be nice for us in a way,\" she remarked. \"Of course you would\\r\\nhave a house in London then, papa, and being an M.P. you would get\\r\\ncards for us to a lot of \\'at homes\\' and things. Only I wish you were a\\r\\nConservative.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A Liberal is much more fashionable than he was,\" Brooks assured her,\\r\\ncheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fashionable! I know the son of a Marquis, a Lord himself, who\\'s a\\r\\nLiberal, and a good one,\" Mr. Bullsom remarked, with a wink to Brooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dears,\" Mrs. Bullsom said, making an effort to rise, and\\r\\nfailing at the first attempt, \"shall we leave the gentlemen to talk\\r\\nabout it over their wine?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you sit down again, mother,\" Selina directed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That sort of thing\\'s quite old-fashioned, isn\\'t it, Mr. Brooks? We\\'re\\r\\ngoing to stay with you. You can smoke. Ann, bring the cigars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bullsom, who was looking forward to a nap in a quiet corner of\\r\\nthe drawing-room, obeyed with resignation written large on her\\r\\ngood-natured, somewhat flushed face. But Mr. Bullsom, who wanted to\\r\\nrevert to the subject which still fascinated him, grunted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hang these new ideas,\" he said. \"It\\'s you they\\'re after, Mr. Brooks.\\r\\nAs a rule, they\\'re off before I can get near my cigar-box.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina affected a little consciousness, which she felt became her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such foolishness, papa. You don\\'t believe it, do you, Mr. Brooks?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Am I not to, then?\" he asked, looking down upon her with a smile.\\r\\nWhereupon Selina\\'s consciousness became confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How stupid you are,\" she murmured. \"You can believe just what you\\r\\nlike. What are you looking at over in the corner of the room?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ghosts,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet very much as those images flitted at that moment through his brain,\\r\\nso events were really shaping themselves in that bare clean-swept room\\r\\ninto which his eyes had for a moment strayed away. Mary Scott was\\r\\nthere, her long apron damp with soap-suds and her cheeks red with\\r\\nexertion, for she had just come from bathing twelve youngsters, who,\\r\\nnot being used to the ordeal, had given trouble. There were other of\\r\\nhis helpers too, a dozen of them up to their eyes in work, and a long\\r\\nstring of applicants patiently waiting their turn. The right sort\\r\\ntoo--the sort from underneath--pale-faced, hollow-eyed, weary, yet for a\\r\\nmoment stirred from their lethargy of suffering at the prospect of some\\r\\npassing relief. There was a young woman, hollow-cheeked, thin herself\\r\\nas a lath, eager for work or chance of work for her husband--that\\r\\nmorning out of hospital, still too delicate to face the night air and\\r\\nthe hot room. He knew shorthand, could keep books, typewrite, a little\\r\\nslip about his character, but that was all over and done with. A bank\\r\\nclerk with L90 a year, obliged to wear a silk hat, who marries a\\r\\npenniless girl on his summer holiday. They must live, both of them,\\r\\nand the gold passed through his fingers day by day, an endless shower.\\r\\nThe magistrates had declined to sentence him, but the shame--and he was\\r\\nnever strong. Brooks saw the card made out for that little cottage at\\r\\nHastings, and enclosed with the railway ticket Owston was picking up\\r\\nfast there--and smiled faintly. He saw the girl on her breathless way\\r\\nhome with the good news, saw her wet face heaven turned for the first\\r\\ntime for many a month. There were men and women in the world with\\r\\nhearts then. They were not all puppets of wood and stone, even as those\\r\\nbank directors. Then, too, she would believe again that there might be\\r\\na God.\\r\\n\\r\\nGhosts! They were plentiful enough. There was the skin-dresser--his\\r\\nfingers still yellow with the dye of the pith. Things were bad in\\r\\nBermondsey. The master had gone bankrupt, the American had filched away\\r\\nhis trade. No one could find him work. He was sober enough except at\\r\\nholiday time and an odd Saturday--a good currier--there might be a\\r\\nchance for him in the country, but how was he to get there? And in any\\r\\ncase now, how could he? His wife had broken down, lay at home with no\\r\\ndisease that a hospital would take her in for, sinking for want of good\\r\\nfood, worn out with hard work, toiling early and late to get food for\\r\\nthe children until her man should get a job. There was the workhouse,\\r\\nbut it meant separation, perhaps for ever, and they were man and wife,\\r\\nas much needed the one by the other, perhaps more, as their prototype in\\r\\nthe world of plenty. Again Brooks smiled. He must have seen Flitch, a\\r\\ncapital chap Flitch, making up that parcel in the grocery department and\\r\\nmaking an appointment for three days\\' time. And Menton, too, the young\\r\\ndoctor, as keen on the work as Brooks himself, but paid for his evenings\\r\\nunder protest, overhears the address--why, it was only a yard or two.\\r\\nHe would run back with the man and have a look at his wife. He had some\\r\\nphysic--he felt sure it was just what she wanted. So out into the\\r\\nstreet together, and no wonder the yellow-stained fingers that grasped\\r\\nthe string of the parcel shook, and the man felt an odd lump in his\\r\\nthroat, and a wave of thankfulness as he passed a flaring public-house\\r\\nwhen half-an-hour ago he had almost plunged madly in to find pluck for\\r\\nthe river--devil\\'s pluck. The woman. Nothing the matter with her but\\r\\nwhat rest and good food would cure. Another case for that little\\r\\ncottage. Lucky there were others being made ready.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What sort of ghosts, Mr. Brooks?\" Selina asked, a little more sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe started, and withdrew his eyes at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, Miss Bullsom,\" he answered, \"just the ghosts we all carry with\\r\\nus, you know, the ghosts of our thoughts, living and dead, good and\\r\\nevil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How funny you are, Mr. Brooks,\" she exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\nA NEW DON QUIXOTE\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks reached London the next evening to find himself famous. The\\r\\nevening papers, one of which he had purchased en route, were one and all\\r\\ndiscussing his new charitable schemes. He found himself held up at once\\r\\nto ridicule and contempt--praised and blamed almost in the same breath.\\r\\nThe Daily Gazette, in an article entitled \"The New Utopia,\" dubbed him\\r\\nthe \"Don Quixote of philanthropy\" the St. James\\'s made other remarks\\r\\nscarcely so flattering. He drove at once to Stepney, and found his\\r\\nheadquarters besieged by a crowd which his little staff of helpers was\\r\\nwholly unable to cope with, and half-a-dozen reporters waiting to snatch\\r\\na word with him. Mary watched his entrance with a little sigh of\\r\\nrelief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m so glad you have come,\" she exclaimed. \"It is hard to send these\\r\\npeople away, but do you know, they have come from all parts of London?\\r\\nNeither Mr. Flitch nor I can make them understand that we can only deal\\r\\nwith cases in the immediate neighbourhood. You must try.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks stood up at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very sorry,\" he said, \"if there has been any misunderstanding, but\\r\\nI want you all to remember this. It is impossible for us to deal with\\r\\nany cases to-night unless you are residents of the immediate\\r\\nneighbourhood. The list of streets is on the front door. Please do not\\r\\npresent yourselves before any of the desks unless you lodge or live in\\r\\none of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a murmur of disappointment, and in the background a few\\r\\ngrowls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope before very long,\" Brooks continued, \"that we shall have a great\\r\\nmany more branches open, and be able to offer help to all of you. But\\r\\nat present we cannot make any exceptions. Will every one except our\\r\\nneighbours please help us by leaving the room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the most part he was obeyed, and then one of the reporters touched\\r\\nhim on the shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-evening, Mr. Brooks. I am representing the Evening Courier. We\\r\\nshould be glad to know what your ideas are as to the future of this new\\r\\ndeparture of yours, and any other information you might cane to give\\r\\nus. There are some others here, I see, on the same errand. Any\\r\\nexclusive information you cared to place at my disposal would be much\\r\\nvalued, and we should take especial pains to put your case fairly before\\r\\nthe public.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really,\" he said, \"it seems as though I were on my defence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reporter took out his pencil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you know,\" he said, \"some of the established charitable\\r\\ninstitutions are rather conservative, and they look upon you as an\\r\\ninterloper, and your methods as a little too broad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" Brooks said, \"if it is to be war between us and the other\\r\\ncharitable institutions you name, I am ready for it, but I cannot talk\\r\\nto you now. As you see, I have an evening\\'s work before me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When can you spare me half-an-hour, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At midnight--my rooms, in, Jermyn Street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reporter closed his book.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t wish to waste your time, sir,\" he answered. \"If you are not\\r\\ngoing to say anything to the others before then I will go away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks nodded. The reporters whispered together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May we stay and watch for a few minutes?\" one of them asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks agreed, and went on with his work. Once more the human flotsam\\r\\nand jetsam, worthy and unworthy, laid bare the sore places in their\\r\\nlives, sometimes with the smooth tongue of deceit, sometimes with the\\r\\nunconscious eloquence of suffering long pent up. One by one they found\\r\\ntheir way into Brooks\\' ledgers as cases to be reckoned out and solved.\\r\\nAnd meanwhile nearly all of them found some immediate relief, passing\\r\\nout into the night with footsteps a little less shuffling, and hearts a\\r\\nlittle lighter. The night\\'s work was a long one. It was eleven o\\'clock\\r\\nbefore Brooks left his seat with a little gesture of relief and lit a\\r\\ncigarette.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go and get something to eat,\" he said. \"Will you come Miss\\r\\nScott?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have to make out a list of things we want for my department,\" she\\r\\nsaid. \"Last night they were nearly all women here. Don\\'t bother about\\r\\nme. Mr. Flitch will put me in an omnibus at London Bridge. You must\\r\\nsee those reporters. You\\'ve read the evening papers, haven\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. I knew we should have opposition. This isn\\'t even the beginning\\r\\nof it. It won\\'t hurt us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless Brooks was anxious to be properly understood, and he talked\\r\\nfor a long time with the reporter, whom he found awaiting him in Jermyn\\r\\nStreet--a pleasant young fellow just back from the war, with the easy\\r\\nmanner and rattling conversation of his order.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You ought to call in and have a chat with the chief, Mr. Brooks,\" he\\r\\nsaid. \"He\\'d be delighted to hear your views personally, I\\'m sure, and\\r\\nI believe you\\'d convert him. He\\'s a bit old-fashioned, you know, that\\r\\nis for a sub--believes in the orthodox societies, and makes a great\\r\\npoint of not encouraging idleness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'d be glad to some time,\" Brooks answered. \"But I can tell you this.\\r\\nIf we can get the money, and I haven\\'t asked for a penny yet, nothing in\\r\\nthe shape of popular opinion is going to stop us. Idleness and\\r\\ndrunkenness, deceit and filthy-mindedness, and all those vices which I\\r\\nadmit are like a pestilence amongst these people, are sins which we are\\r\\nresponsible for, not them, and, of course, we must suffer to some\\r\\nextent from them. But we\\'ve got to grapple with them. We shall be\\r\\ntaken advantage of, and grossly deceived continually. I know of one or\\r\\ntwo cases already. We expect it--count upon it. But in the end we\\r\\nshall come out on the top. If we are consistent the thing will right\\r\\nitself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a young man to be so interested in philanthropic work, Mr.\\r\\nBrooks Every one seems to consider philanthropy the pursuit of the old,\"\\r\\nBrooks answered. \"I don\\'t know why, I am sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And may I ask if that is a sample of your daily correspondence?\" he\\r\\nasked, pointing to the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks looked at the enormous pile of letters and shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never had more than twenty letters at a time in my life,\" he\\r\\nanswered. \"There seems to be almost as many thousands there. It is, I\\r\\nsuppose, a result of the Press booming our modest little show. I can\\r\\nscarcely feel as grateful as I should like to. Have another pipe, will\\r\\nyou--or a cigar? I think unless there\\'s anything else you\\'d like to\\r\\nask I\\'d better begin on these.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing more, thanks,\" the pressman answered; \"but if I might I\\'d like\\r\\nto stay while you open a few. There might be something interesting. If\\r\\nyou\\'ll forgive my remarking it, there seem to be a good many registered\\r\\nletters. I understood that you had not appealed to the public for\\r\\nsubscriptions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neither have I,\" Brooks answered, stretching out his hand. \"If there\\r\\nis money in these it is entirely unsolicited.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe plunged into a correspondence as various as it was voluminous. There\\r\\nwere letters of abuse, of sympathy, of friendship, of remonstrance, of\\r\\nreproof. There were offers of help, money, advice, suggestions, and\\r\\nadvertisements. There were small sums of money, and a few larger ones.\\r\\nHe was amused to find that a great many people addressed him as an\\r\\ninfidel--the little mission preacher had certainly been busy, and\\r\\neverywhere it seemed to be understood that his enterprise was an\\r\\nanti-Christian one. And finally there was a long packet, marked as\\r\\nhaving been delivered by hand, and inside--without a word of any sort,\\r\\non a single clue as to its sender--a bank-note for one thousand pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks passed it over to his companion, who saw the amount with a little\\r\\nstart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A thousand pounds--not even registered--in a plain envelope. And you\\r\\nhave no idea from whom it came?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None whatever,\" Brooks answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pressman folded it up silently, and passed it back. He looked at\\r\\nthe huge pile of correspondence and at Brooks--his dark thoughtful face\\r\\nsuddenly lit up with a rare gleam of excitement. In his own mind he was\\r\\nmaking a thumb-nail sketch of these things. There was material for\\r\\none of those broad, suggestive articles which his editor loved. He\\r\\nwished Brooks good-night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m much obliged for all you\\'ve told me,\" he said. \"If you don\\'t mind,\\r\\nI\\'d like to drop in now and again down at Stepney. I believe that this\\r\\nis going to be rather a big thing for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So do I,\" he answered. \"Come whenever you like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks sank into an easy-chair, conscious at last of a more than\\r\\nordinary exhaustion. He looked at the pile of newspapers at his feet,\\r\\nthe sea of correspondence on the table--his thoughts travelled back to\\r\\nthe bare, dusty room in Stepney, with its patient, white-faced crowd of\\r\\nmen and women and children. Perhaps, after all, then he had found his\\r\\nlife\\'s work here. If so he need surely regret no longer his lost\\r\\npolitical opportunities. Yet in his heart he knew that it had been from\\r\\nthe House of Commons he had meant to force home his schemes. To work\\r\\noutside had always seemed to him to be labouring under a disadvantage,\\r\\nto be missing the true and best opportunity of impressing upon the\\r\\nlaw-makers of the country their true responsibilities. But of that\\r\\nthere was no longer any hope. Of the House of Lords he thought only\\r\\nwith a cold shiver. No, political life was denied to him. He must do\\r\\nhis best for the furtherance of his work outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe fell asleep to awake in the cold grey of the morning, stiff and\\r\\ncramped, and cold to the bone. Stamping up and down the room in a\\r\\nvigorous attempt to restore his lost circulation, he noticed as he\\r\\npassed the corner of the table a still unopened letter addressed to him\\r\\nin a familiar handwriting. He took it over to the window, and, glancing\\r\\nat the faintly-sketched coronet on time back, turned it over and broke\\r\\nthe seal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"ST. JAMES\\'S HOUSE, LONDON.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thursday.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR BROOKS,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have read with an amusement which I am sure you will not fail to\\r\\nshare, the shower of condemnation, approval, and remonstrance which by\\r\\nyour doings in Stepney you appear to have brought down upon your head.\\r\\nThe religious element especially, you seem to have set by the ears. I\\r\\nsat within hearing of our premier bishop last night at dinner, and his\\r\\nspeculations with regard to you and your ultimate aims were so amusing\\r\\nthat I passed without noticing it my favourite entree.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will have observed that it is your anonymity which is the weapon of\\r\\nwhich your antagonists make most use. Why not dissipate it and confound\\r\\nthem? A Mr. Brooks of unknown antecedents might well be supposed\\r\\ncapable of starting a philanthropic work for his own good; the same\\r\\nsuspicion could never fall on Lord Kingston Ross, a future marquis. You\\r\\nwill notice that I make no appeal to you from any personal motive. I\\r\\nshould suggest that we preserve our present relations without\\r\\nalteration. But if you care to accept my suggestion I would propose\\r\\nthat you nominate me trustee of your society, and I will give, as a\\r\\ncontribution to its funds, the sum of five thousand pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks looked down the long street, quiet and strangely unfamiliar in\\r\\nthe dawning light, and for a moment he hesitated. The letter he held in\\r\\nhis hand crushed up into a shapeless ball. It would make things very\\r\\neasy. And then--a rush of memories. He swung round and sat down at his\\r\\ndesk, drawing paper and ink towards him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR LORD ARRANMORE,\" he wrote, \"I am much obliged to you for the\\r\\nsuggestion contained in your letter, but I regret that its acceptance\\r\\nwould involve the carrying out on my part of certain obligations which I\\r\\nam not at present prepared to undertake. We will, therefore, if you\\r\\nplease, allow matters to remain on this footing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yours sincerely,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"KINGSTON BROOKS.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBareheaded he stole out into the street, and breathed freely only when\\r\\nhe heard it drop into the pillar-box. For only he himself knew what\\r\\nother things went with the rejection of that offer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe crept up-stairs to lie down for a while, and \\'on the way he laughed\\r\\nsoftly to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a fool she would think me!\" he muttered. \"What a fool I am!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART III\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\nAN ARISTOCRATIC RECRUIT\\r\\n\\r\\nAn early spring came with a rush of warm west wind, sunshine, and the\\r\\nperfume of blossoming flowers. The chestnuts where out at the Park fully\\r\\na week before their time, and already through the great waxy buds the\\r\\ncolour of the coming rhododendrons was to be seen in sheltered corners\\r\\nof the Park. London put out its window boxes, and remembered that it\\r\\nhad, after all, for two short months a place amongst the beautiful\\r\\ncities of the world. \\'Bus conductors begun to whistle, and hansom cab\\r\\ndrivers to wear a bunch of primroses in their coats. Kingston Brooks,\\r\\nwho had just left his doctor, turned into the Park and mingled idly with\\r\\nthe throng of people.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time for many months he suffered his thoughts to travel\\r\\nover a wider range than usual. The doctor\\'s words had been sharp and to\\r\\nthe point. He must have instant change--change, if not of scene, at\\r\\nleast of occupation. Scarcely to be wondered at, Brooks thought to\\r\\nhimself, with a faint smile, when he thought of the last twelve months,\\r\\nfull to the brim of strenuous labour, of ceaseless striving within a\\r\\nherculean task. Well, he was in smoother waters now. He might\\r\\nwithdraw his hand for a while, if necessary. He had gone his way, and\\r\\nheld his own so far against all manner of onslaught. Just then he heard\\r\\nhimself called by name, and, looking up, found himself face to face\\r\\nwith Sybil Caroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Brooks! Is it really you, then, at last?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe set his teeth hard, but he could not keep the unusual colour from\\r\\nhis cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is really I, Lady Sybil. How do you do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil was charming in a lilac-coloured dress and hat as fresh and dainty\\r\\nas her own complexion. She looked straight into his eyes, and told him\\r\\nthat he ought to be ashamed of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, it\\'s not the least use your looking as though you were going to\\r\\nedge away every moment,\" she declared, laughing. \"I am going to keep\\r\\nyou for quite a long time, and make you tell me about everything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In which case, Lady Sybil,\" her escort remarked, good-humouredly, \"you\\r\\nwill perhaps find a better use for me at some future time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How sweet of you,\" she answered, blandly. \"Do you know Mr. Brooks?\\r\\nMr. Kingston Brooks, Lord Bertram. Mr. Brooks is a very old friend,\\r\\nand I have so many questions I want to ask him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Bertram, a slim, aristocratic young man, raised his hat, and\\r\\nglanced with some interest at the other man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Mr. Kingston Brooks of the East End? Lavvy\\'s friend?\" he asked,\\r\\npolitely.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid,\" he said, \"that I am the person who is being\\r\\nexposed--isn\\'t that the word? I warn you, Lady Sybil, that I am a\\r\\nquestionable character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will take the risk,\" she answered, gaily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you may safely do so,\" Lord Bertram answered, raising his hat.\\r\\n\"Good-morning, Lady Sybil--morning, Mr. Brooks!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe led him towards the chairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am going to take the risk of your being in an extravagant frame of\\r\\nmind,\" she said, \"and make you pay for two chains--up here, on the back\\r\\nnow. Now, first of all, do you know that you look shockingly ill?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have just come from-n my doctor,\" Brooks answered. \"He agrees with\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad that you have had the sense to go to him,\" she said. \"Tell\\r\\nme, are you just run down, on is there anything more serious the matter?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing serious at all,\" he answered. \"I have had a great deal to do,\\r\\nand no holiday during the past year, so I suppose I am a little tired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You look like a ghost,\" she said. \"You have been overworking yourself\\r\\nridiculously. Now, will you be so good as to tell me why you have\\r\\nnever been to see us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been nowhere,\" he answered. \"My work has claimed my\\r\\nundivided attention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense,\" she answered. \"You have been living for a year within a\\r\\nshilling cab ride of us, and you have not once even called. I really\\r\\nwonder that I am sitting here with you, as though prepared to forgive\\r\\nyou. Do you know that I have written you three times asking you to come\\r\\nto tea?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned a very white face upon her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Won\\'t you understand,\" he said, \"that I have been engrossed in a work\\r\\nwhich would admit of no distractions?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You could find time to go down to Medchester, and make speeches for\\r\\nyour friend Mr. Bullsom,\" she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was different. I was deeply indebted to Mr. Bullsom, and anxious\\r\\nto see him returned. That, too, was work. It is only pleasures which I\\r\\nhave denied myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That,\" she remarked, \"is the nicest--in fact, the only nice thing you\\r\\nhave said. You have changed since Enton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been through a good deal,\" he said, wearily.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shuddered a little.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t look like that,\" she exclaimed. \"Forgive me, but you made me\\r\\nthink--do you remember that night at Enton, when Lord Arranmore spoke\\r\\nof his work amongst the poor, how the hopelessness of it began to haunt\\r\\nhim and weigh upon him till he reached the verge of madness. You had\\r\\nsomething of that look just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smiled faintly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Believe me, it was fancy,\" he answered, earnestly. \"Remember, I am a\\r\\nlittle out of sorts to-day. I am not discouraged; I have no cause to be\\r\\ndiscouraged. A good many of the outside public misunderstand my work,\\r\\nand Mr. Lavilette thinks I make money out of it. Then, of course, all\\r\\nthe organized charities are against me. But in spite of all I am able\\r\\nto go on and increase day by day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is wonderful,\" she declared. \"I read everything in the papers about\\r\\nyou--and I get the monthly reports, for of course I am a subscriber--so\\r\\nis mother. But--that brings your shameful neglect of us back into my\\r\\nmind. I wrote to you begging to be allowed to inspect one of your\\r\\nbranches, and all I got back was a polite reply from your secretary to\\r\\nthe effect that the general public--even subscribers--were never allowed\\r\\nin any of the branches as sightseers, and that all I could see was the\\r\\nstores and general arrangements, for which he enclosed a view-card.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" Brooks said, \"you don\\'t think that poor people who come to you\\r\\nfor help should be exposed to the casual inspection of visitors who want\\r\\nto see how it is done, do you? I have always been very particular about\\r\\nthat. We should not allow the Prince of Wales in the room whilst we\\r\\nwere dealing with applicants.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you might have written yourself, or come and seen us,\" Sybil\\r\\ndeclared, a little irrelevantly. \"Why couldn\\'t I be an occasional\\r\\nhelper?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is not the slightest reason why you should not,\" he answered.\\r\\n\"We have seventeen hundred on the books, but we could always do with\\r\\nmore, especially now we are opening so many more branches. But, you\\r\\nknow, we should expect you to come sometimes, and how would Lady Caroom\\r\\nlike that?\" She laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know how much mother and I interfere with one another,\" she\\r\\nanswered. \"Besides, I have several friends who are on your list, and\\r\\nwho are sent for now and then--Edie Gresham and Mary Forbrooke.\" \"It is\\r\\nrough work,\" he said; \"but, of course, if you like, my secretary shall\\r\\nput your name down, and you will get a card then telling you what week\\r\\nto come. It will be every afternoon for a week, you know. Then you are\\r\\nqualified, and we might send for you at any time if we were short.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should come,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nA coach passed by, with its brilliant load of women in bright gowns and\\r\\npicture hats, and two or three immaculate men. They both looked up, and\\r\\nfollowed it with their eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Arranmore,\" Sybil exclaimed, \"and that is the Duchess of\\r\\nEversleigh with him on the box. It doesn\\'t seem--the same man, does\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks smiled a little bitterly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The same man,\" he repeated. \"No!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were silent for a few moments. Then Sybil turned towards him with\\r\\na little impetuous movement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" she said, \"let us talk about yourself now. What are you going\\r\\nto do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To do?\" he repeated, vaguely. \"Why--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About your health, of course. You admitted a few minutes ago that you\\r\\nhad been to see your doctor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why--I suppose I must ease up a little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course you must. When will you come and dine quietly with us in\\r\\nBerkeley Square, and go to the theatre?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is kind of you,\" he said, \"but--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When will you come and have tea with me, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe set his teeth. He had done his best.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whenever you choose to ask me,\" he answered, with a sort of dogged\\r\\nresignation.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him half curiously, half tenderly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are so much changed,\" she murmured, \"since those days at Enton.\\r\\nYou were a boy then, although you were a thoughtful one--now you are a\\r\\nman, and when you speak like that, an old man. Come, I want the other\\r\\nMr. Brooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat quite still. Perhaps at that moment of detachment he realized\\r\\nmore keenly than ever the withering nature of this battle through which\\r\\nhe had passed. Indeed, he felt older. Those days at Enton lay very far\\r\\nback, yet the girl by his side made him feel as though they had been but\\r\\nyesterday. He glanced at her covertly. Gracious, fresh, and as\\r\\nbeautiful as the spring itself. What demon of mischief had possessed\\r\\nher that she should, with all her army of admirers, her gay life, her\\r\\nhost of pleasures, still single him out in this way and bring back to\\r\\nhis memory days which he had told himself he had wholly forgotten? She\\r\\nwas not of the world of his adoption, she belonged to the things which\\r\\nhe had forsworn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The other Mr. Brooks,\" he murmured, \"is dead. He has been burned in\\r\\nthe furnace of this last wonderful year. That is why I think--I fear it\\r\\nis no use your looking for him--and you would not wish to have a\\r\\nstranger to tea with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That,\" she said, \"is ingenious, but not convincing. So you will please\\r\\ncome to-morrow at four o\\'clock. I shall stay in for you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At four o\\'clock,\" he repeated, helplessly.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom waved to them from the path.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sybil, come here at once,\" she exclaimed, \"and bring Mr. Brooks with\\r\\nyou. Dear me, what troublesome people you have been to find. I am very\\r\\nglad indeed to see you again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked Brooks in the face as she held his hand, and With a little\\r\\nstart he realized that she knew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You most quixotic of young men,\" she exclaimed, \"come home with us at\\r\\nonce, and explain how you dared to avoid us all this time. What a ghost\\r\\nyou look. I hope it is your conscience. Don\\'t pretend you can\\'t sit\\r\\nwith your back to the horse, but get in there, sir, and--James, the\\r\\nlittle seat--and make yourself as comfortable as you can. Home, James!\\r\\nUpon my word, Mr. Brooks, you look like one of those poor people whom\\r\\nyou have been working for in the slums. If starvation was catching, I\\r\\nshould think that you had caught it. You must try my muffins.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil caught his eye, and laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mother hasn\\'t altered much, has she?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. LAVILETTE INTERFERES\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is this Kingston Brooks\\' affair that Lavilette has hold of now?\"\\r\\nyawned a man over his evening papers. \"That fellow will get into\\r\\ntrouble if he doesn\\'t mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some new sort of charity down in the East End,\" one of the little group\\r\\nof club members replied. \"Fellow has a lot of branches, and tries to\\r\\nmake \\'em a sort of family affair. He gets a pile of subscriptions, and\\r\\ndeclines to publish a balance-sheet. Lavilette seems to think there\\'s\\r\\nsomething wrong somewhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lavilette\\'s such a suspicious beggar,\" another man remarked. \"The\\r\\nthing seems all right. I know people who are interested in it, who say\\r\\nit\\'s the most comprehensive and common-sense charity scheme of the day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why doesn\\'t he pitch into Lavilette, then? Lavilette\\'s awfully\\r\\ninsulting. Brooks the other day inserted an acknowledgment in the\\r\\npapers of the receipt of one thousand pounds anonymous. You saw what\\r\\nLavilette said about it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. What?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, he had a little sarcastic paragraph--declined to believe that Brooks\\r\\nhad ever received a thousand pounds anonymously--challenged him to give\\r\\nthe number of the note, and said plainly that he considered it a fraud.\\r\\nThere\\'s been no reply from Brooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you know?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This week\\'s Verity. Here it is!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have received no reply from Mr. Kingston Brooks up to going to\\r\\npress with respect to our remark concerning the thousand pounds alleged\\r\\nto have been received by him from an anonymous giver. We may add that\\r\\nwe scarcely expected it. Yet there is another long list of\\r\\nacknowledgments of sums received by Mr. Brooks this morning. We are\\r\\neither the most credulous nation in the world, or there are a good many\\r\\npeople who don\\'t know what to do with their money. We should like to\\r\\ndirect their attention to half-a-dozen excellent and most deserving\\r\\ncharities which we can personally recommend, and whose accounts will\\r\\nalways stand the most vigorous examination.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"H\\'m! That\\'s pretty strong,\" the first speaker remarked. \"I should\\r\\nthink that that ought to stay the flow of subscriptions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore, who was standing on the hearthrug smoking a cigarette,\\r\\njoined languidly in the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou think that Brooks ought to take some notice of Lavilette\\'s\\r\\nimpudence, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'m afraid his not doing so looks rather fishy,\" the first\\r\\nspeaker remarked. \"That thousand pounds note must have been a sort of a\\r\\nmyth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think not,\" Lord Arranmore remarked, quietly. \"I ought to know, for\\r\\nI sent it myself,\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery man straightened himself in his easy-chair. There was a little\\r\\nthrill of interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re joking, Arranmore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I! I\\'ve sent him three amounts--anonymously.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'d no idea that sort of thing was in your line,\" one of the men\\r\\nexclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More it is,\" Arranmore answered. \"Personally, I don\\'t believe in\\r\\ncharity--in any modern application of it at any rate. But this man\\r\\nBrooks is a decent sort.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know who Brooks is, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly. He was my agent for a short time in Medchester.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hennibul, who was one of the men sitting round, doubled his copy of\\r\\nVerity up and beat the air with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew I\\'d heard the name,\" he exclaimed. \"Why, I\\'ve met him down at\\r\\nEnton. Nice-looking young fellow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. That was Brooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hennibul\\'s face beamed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Great Scott, what a haul!\" he exclaimed. \"Why, you\\'ve got old\\r\\nLavilette on toast--you\\'ve got him for suing damages too. If this is\\r\\nwhy Brooks has been hanging back--just to let him go far enough--by\\r\\nJove, he\\'s a smart chap.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t fancy Brooks has any idea of the sort,\" Lord Arranmore\\r\\nanswered. \"All the same I think that Lavilette must be stopped and made\\r\\nto climb down.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCuriously enough he met Brooks the same afternoon in Lady Caroom\\'s\\r\\ndrawing-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is fortunate,\" he remarked. \"I wished for a few minutes\\'\\r\\nconversation with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am at your service,\" Brooks answered, quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was fairly full, so they moved a little on one side. Lord\\r\\nArranmore for a moment or two studied his son\\'s face in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You show signs of the struggle,\" he remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been overworked,\" Brooks answered. \"A week or two\\'s holiday is\\r\\nall I require--and that I am having. As for the rest,\" he answered,\\r\\nlooking Lord Arranmore in the face, \"I am not discouraged. I am not\\r\\neven depressed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I congratulate you--upon your zeal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was going to speak to you,\" Lord Arranmore continued, \"concerning the\\r\\nparagraph in this week\\'s Verity, and these other attacks which you seem\\r\\nto have provoked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You too!\" he exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I also!\" Lord Arranmore admitted, coolly. \"You scarcely see how it\\r\\nconcerns me, of course, but in a remote sense it does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid that I am a little dense,\" Brooks remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not embarrass you with any explanation,\" Lord Arranmore\\r\\nremarked. \"But all the same I am going to surprise you. Do you know\\r\\nthat I am very much interested in your experiment?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks raised his eyebrows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I am very much interested,\" Lord Arranmore repeated. \"I should\\r\\nlike you to understand that my views as to charity and charitable\\r\\nmatters remain absolutely unaltered. But at the same time I am anxious\\r\\nthat you should test your schemes properly and unhampered by any\\r\\npressure from outside. You are all the sooner likely to grow out of\\r\\nconceit with them. Therefore let me offer you a word of advice.\\r\\nPublish your accounts, and sue Lavvy for a thousand pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks was silent for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My own idea,\" he said, slowly, \"was to take no notice of these attacks.\\r\\nThe offices where the financial part of our concern is managed are open\\r\\nto our subscribers at any time, and the books are there for their\\r\\ninspection. It is only at the branches where we do not admit visitors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must remember,\" Lord Arranmore said, \"that these attacks have been\\r\\ngrowing steadily during the last few months. It is, of course, no\\r\\nconcern of mine, but if they are left unanswered surely your funds must\\r\\nsuffer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There have been no signs of it up to the present,\" Brooks answered.\\r\\n\"We have large sums of money come in every day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This worst attack,\" Lord Arranmore remarked, \"only appeared in this\\r\\nweek\\'s Verity. It is bound to have some effect.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not fear it,\" he answered, calmly. \"As a matter of fact, however,\\r\\nI am going to form a council to take the management of the financial\\r\\norganization. It is getting too large a thing for me with all my other\\r\\nwork. Is there anything else you wished to say to me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eyes of the two men met for a moment both unflinchingly. Perhaps\\r\\nthey were each searching for something they could not find.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is nothing else. Don\\'t let me detain you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks, who was the leaving guest, stepped quietly away, and Lord\\r\\nArranmore calmly outstayed all the other callers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your manners,\" Lady Caroom told him, as the last of her guests\\r\\ndeparted, \"are simply hoydenish. Who told you that you might sit out\\r\\nall my visitors in this bare-faced way?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You, dear lady, or rather your manner,\" he answered, imperturbably.\\r\\n\"It seemed to me that you were saying all the time, \\'Do not desert me!\\r\\nDo not desert me!\\' And so I sat tight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An imagination like yours,\" she declared, \"is positively unhealthy.\\r\\nArranmore, what an idiot you are.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you know all about it--and one hears! Are you tired of your life?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very, very tired of it!\" he answered. \"Isn\\'t everybody?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course not. Neither are you really. It is only a mood. Some day\\r\\nyou will succeed in what you seem trying so hard to do, and then you\\r\\nwill be sorry--and perhaps some others!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If one could believe that,\" he murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two months ago,\" she continued, \"every one was saying that you had made\\r\\nup your mind to end your days in the hunting-field. All Melton was\\r\\ntalking about your reckless riding, and your hairbreadth escapes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Both shockingly exaggerated,\" he said, under his breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps; but apart from the papers I have seen people who were out and\\r\\nwho have told me that you rode with absolute recklessness, simply and\\r\\npurely for a fall, and that you deserved to break your neck a dozen\\r\\ntimes over. Then there was your week in Paris with Prince Comfrere, and\\r\\nnow your supper-parties are the talk of London.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are justly famed,\" he answered, gravely, \"for you know I brought\\r\\nhome the chef from Voillard\\'s. I am sorry that I cannot ask you to one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be ridiculous, Arranmore. Why do you do these things? Does it\\r\\namuse you, give you any satisfaction?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word I don\\'t know,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then why do you do it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because,\" he said slowly, \"there is a shadow which dogs me. I am\\r\\nalways trying to escape--and it is always hard on my heels. You are a\\r\\nwoman, Catherine, and you don\\'t know the suffering of the most\\r\\nintolerable form of ennui--loneliness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you?\" she asked, looking at him with softening eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Always. It rode with me in the turnkey frill--and sometimes perhaps it\\r\\nlifted my spurs--why not? And at these suppers you speak of, well, they\\r\\nare all very gay--it is I only who have bidden them, who reap no profit.\\r\\nFor whosoever may sit there the chair at my side is always empty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You speak sadly,\" she said, \"and yet--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To hear you talk, Arranmore, with any real feeling about anything is\\r\\nalways a relief,\" she said. \"Sometimes you speak and act as though\\r\\nevery emotion which had ever filled your life were dead, as though you\\r\\nwere indeed but the shadow of your former self. Even to know that you\\r\\nfeel pain is better than to believe you void of any feeling whatever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you may rest content,\" he told her quietly, \"for I can assure you\\r\\nthat pain and I are old friends and close companions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have so much, too, which should make you happy--which should keep\\r\\nyou employed and amused,\" she said, softly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Employed and amused.\\'\" His eyes flashed upon her with a gleam of\\r\\nsomething very much like anger. \"It pleases you to mock me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed no!\" she protested. \"You must not say such things to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then remember,\" he said, bitterly, \"that sympathy from you comes always\\r\\nvery near to mockery. It is you and you alone who can unlock the door\\r\\nfor me. You show me the key--but you will not use it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA belated caller straggled in, and Arranmore took his leave. Lady\\r\\nCaroom for the rest of the afternoon was a little absent. She gave her\\r\\nvisitors cold tea, and seriously imperiled her reputation as a charming\\r\\nand sympathetic hostess.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SINGULAR BEHAVIOUR OF MARY SCOTT\\r\\n\\r\\nThe looking-glass was, perhaps, a little merciless in that clear north\\r\\nlight, but Mary\\'s sigh as she looked away from it was certainly\\r\\nunwarranted. For, as a matter of fact, she had improved wonderfully\\r\\nsince her coming to London. A certain angularity of figure had\\r\\nvanished--the fashionable clothes which Mr. Bullsom had insisted upon\\r\\nordering for her did ample justice to her graceful curves and lithe\\r\\nbuoyant figure. The pallor of her cheeks, too, which she had eyed just\\r\\nnow with so much dissatisfaction, was far removed from the pallor of\\r\\nill-health; her mouth, which had lost its discontented droop, was full\\r\\nof pleasant suggestions of humour. She was distinctly a very charming\\r\\nand attractive young woman--and yet she turned away with a sigh. She\\r\\nwas twenty-seven years old, and she had been unconsciously comparing\\r\\nherself with a girl of eighteen.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe drew down one of the blinds and set the tea-tray where she could sit\\r\\nin the shadow. She was conscious of having dressed with unusual\\r\\ncare--she had pinned a great bunch of fragrant violets in her bosom.\\r\\nShe acknowledged to herself frankly that she was anxious to appear at\\r\\nher best. For there had come to her, in the midst of her busy life--a\\r\\nlife of strenuous endeavour mingled with many small self-denials--a\\r\\ncertain sense of loneliness--of insufficiency--a new thing to her and\\r\\nhard to cope with in this great city where friends were few. And last\\r\\nnight, whilst she had been thinking of it, came this note from Brooks\\r\\nasking if he might come to tea. She had been ashamed of herself ever\\r\\nsince. It was maddening that she should sit waiting for his coming like\\r\\na blushing schoolgirl--the colour ready enough to stream into her face\\r\\nat the sound of his footstep.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came at last--a surprise in more ways than one. For he had abandoned\\r\\nthe blue serge and low hat of his daily life, and was attired in frock\\r\\ncoat and silk hat--his tie and collar of a new fashion, even his bearing\\r\\naltered--at least so it seemed to her jealous observation. He was\\r\\ncertainly looking better. There was colour in his pale cheeks, and his\\r\\neyes were bright once more with the joy of life. Her dark eyes took\\r\\nmerciless note of these things, and then found seeing at all a little\\r\\ndifficult.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mary,\" he exclaimed, cheerfully--he had fallen into the way of\\r\\ncalling her Mary lately \"this is delightful of you to be in. Do you\\r\\nknow that I am really holiday-making?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" she answered, smiling, \"I imagined that you were not on your way\\r\\neastwards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where can I sit? May I move these?\" He swept aside a little pile of\\r\\nnewspapers and books, and took possession of the seat which she had\\r\\npurposely appropriated. \"The other chairs are so far off, and you seem\\r\\nto have chosen a dark corner. Eastwards, no. I have been at the\\r\\noffice all the morning, and we have bought the property in Poplar Grove\\r\\nand the house in Bermondsey. Now I have finished for the day. Doctor\\'s\\r\\norders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If any one has earned a holiday,\" she said, quietly, \"you have. There\\r\\nis some cake on the table there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thanks. Well, it was hard work at first. How we stuck at it down at\\r\\nStepney, didn\\'t we? Six in the morning till twelve at night. And then\\r\\nhow we rushed ahead. It seems to me that we have been doing nothing but\\r\\nopen branches lately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder,\" she said, \"that you have stood it so well. Why don\\'t you go\\r\\naway altogether for a time? You have such splendid helpers now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I\\'m enjoying myself,\" he answered, lightly, \"and I don\\'t care to be\\r\\nout of touch with it all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You enjoy contrasts,\" she remarked. \"I saw your name in the paper this\\r\\nmorning as one of Lady Caroom\\'s guests last night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Lady Caroom has been awfully good to me, and I seem to have got to\\r\\nknow a lot of pleasant people in an incredulously short time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a curious mixture,\" she said, looking at him thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of what?\" he asked, passing his cup for some more tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of wonderful self-devotion,\" she answered, \"and a genuine and natural\\r\\nlove of enjoyment. After all, you are only a boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I fancy,\" he remarked, smiling, \"that my years exceed yours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As a matter of fact they don\\'t,\" she answered, \"but I was not thinking\\r\\nof years, I was thinking of disposition. You have set going the\\r\\ngreatest charitable scheme of the generation, and yet you are so young,\\r\\nso very young.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed a little uneasily. In some vague way he felt that he had\\r\\ndispleased her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never pretended,\" he said, \"that I did not enjoy life, that I was not\\r\\nfond of its pleasures. It was only while my work was insecure that I\\r\\nmade a recluse of myself. You, too,\" he said, \"it is time that you\\r\\nslackened a little. Come, take an evening off and we will dine\\r\\nsomewhere and go to the theatre.\" How delightful it sounded. She felt\\r\\na warm rush of pleasure at the thought. They would want her badly at\\r\\nStepney, but \"This evening?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. No, hang it, it can\\'t be this evening. I\\'m dining with the\\r\\nCarooms--nor to-morrow evening. Say Thursday evening, will you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething seemed suddenly to chill her momentary gush of happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" she said, \"I think not just yet. We have several fresh girls,\\r\\nyou know--it is a bad time to be away. Perhaps you will ask me later\\r\\non.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed softly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a funny girl you are, Mary. You\\'d really rather stew in that hot\\r\\nroom, I believe, than go anywhere to enjoy yourself. Such women as you\\r\\nought to be canonized. You are saints even in this life. What can be\\r\\ndone for you in the next?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary bit her lip hard, and she bent low over the tea-cups. In another\\r\\nmoment she felt that her self-control must go. Fortunately he drifted\\r\\naway from the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very soon,\" he said, \"we must all have a serious talk about the future.\\r\\nThe management is getting too big for me. I think there should be a\\r\\ncouncil elected--something of the sort must be done, and soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That,\" she remarked, \"is what Mr. Lavilette says, isn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her with twinkling eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you needn\\'t think I\\'m being scared into it,\" he answered. \"All the\\r\\nsame, Lavvy\\'s right enough. No one man has the right to accept large\\r\\nsubscriptions and not let the public into his confidence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lavilette doesn\\'t believe in our anonymous subscriptions, does he?\" she\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! He\\'s rather impudent about that, isn\\'t he? I suppose I ought\\r\\nreally to set him right. I should have done so before, but he went\\r\\nabout it in such an offensive manner. Well, to go on with what I was\\r\\nsaying. You will come on the council, Mary?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I? Oh, surely not!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will! And, what is more, I am going to split all the branches up\\r\\ninto divisions, and appoint superintendents and manageresses, at a\\r\\nreasonable salary. And you,\" he concluded, \"are going to be one of the\\r\\nlatter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head firmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! I must remain my own mistress.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not? I want to allot to you the work where you can do most good.\\r\\nYou know more about it than any one. There is no one half so suitable.\\r\\nI want you to throw up your other work come into this altogether, be my\\r\\nright hand, and let me feel that I have one person on the council whom I\\r\\ncan rely upon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was silent for a moment. She leaned back in her chair, but even in\\r\\nthe semi-obscurity the extreme pallor of her face troubled him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must remember, too,\" he said, \"that the work will not be so hard as\\r\\nnow. Lately you have given us too much of your time. Indeed, I am not\\r\\nsure that it is not you who need a holiday more than I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe raised her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is--what you came to say to me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. I was anxious to get your promise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was another short silence. Then she spoke in dull even tones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must think it over. You want my whole time, and you want to pay me\\r\\nfor it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. It is only reasonable, and we can afford it. I should draw a\\r\\nsalary myself if I had not a little of my own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe raised her eyes once more to his mercilessly, and drew a quick\\r\\nlittle breath. Yes, it was there written in his face--the blank utter\\r\\nindifference of good-fellowship. It was all that he had come to ask\\r\\nher, it was all that he would ever ask her. Suddenly she felt her heart\\r\\nthrobbing in quick short beats-her cheeks burned. They were alone--even\\r\\nher little maid had gone out. Why was he so miserably indifferent? She\\r\\nstumbled to her feet, and suddenly stooping down laid her burning cheeks\\r\\nagainst his.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kingston,\" she said, \"you are so cruel--and I am so lonely. Can\\'t you\\r\\nsee that I am miserable? Kiss me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks sat petrified, utterly amazed at this self-yielding on the part of\\r\\nthe last woman in this world whom he would ever have thought capable of\\r\\nanything of the sort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kiss me--at once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe touched her lips timorously. Then she sprang away from him, her\\r\\ncheeks aflame, her eyes on fire, her hair strangely ruffled. She\\r\\npointed to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please go--quickly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe picked up his hat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Mary! I--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stamped her foot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will write. You shall hear from me to-morrow. But if you have any\\r\\npity for me at all you will go now--this moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose and went. She heard him turn the handle of the door, heard his\\r\\nfootsteps upon the stone stairs outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe counted them idly. One, two, three, four now he was on the next\\r\\nlanding. She heard them again, less distinctly, always less distinctly.\\r\\nThen silence. She ran to the window. There he was upon the pavement,\\r\\nnow he was crossing the road on his way to the underground station. She\\r\\ntore at her handkerchief, waved it wildly for a moment--and then\\r\\nstopped. He was gone--and she. The hot colour came rushing painfully\\r\\ninto her cheeks. She threw herself face downwards upon the sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nLORD ARRANMORE IN A NEW ROLE\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The epoch-making nights of one\\'s life,\" Mr. Hennibul remarked, \"are\\r\\nfew. Let us sit down and consider what has happened.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A seat,\" Lady Caroom sighed. \"What luxury! But where?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My knowledge of the geography of this house,\" Mr. Hennibul answered,\\r\\n\"has more than once been of the utmost service to me, but I have never\\r\\nappreciated it more than at this moment. Accept my arm, Lady Caroom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey made a slow circuit of the room, passed through an ante-chamber and\\r\\ncame out in a sort of winter-garden looking over the Park. Lady Caroom\\r\\nexclaimed with delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You dear man,\" she exclaimed. \"Of course I knew of this place--isn\\'t\\r\\nit charming?--but I had no idea that we could reach it from the\\r\\nreception-rooms. Let us move our chairs over there. We can sit and\\r\\nwatch the hansoms turn into Piccadilly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It shall be as you say,\" he answered. \"I wonder if all London is as\\r\\nexcited to-night as the crowd we have just left.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To me,\" she murmured, \"London seems always imperturbable, stonily\\r\\nindifferent to good or evil. I believe that on the eve of a revolution\\r\\nwe should dine and go to the theatre, choose our houses at which to\\r\\nspend the evening, and avoid sweet champagne with the same care. You\\r\\nand I may know that to-night England has thrown overboard a national\\r\\npolicy. Yet I doubt whether either of us will sleep the less soundly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not only that,\" he said, \"but the Government have to-day shown\\r\\nthemselves possessed of a penetration and appreciation of mind for which\\r\\nI for one scarcely gave them credit. They have made me a peer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him with an amused smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They make judges and peers for two reasons\" she remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That, Lady Caroom, is unkind,\" he said. \"I can assure you that\\r\\nthroughout my career I have never made a nuisance of myself to any one.\\r\\nIn the House I have been a model member, and I have always obeyed my\\r\\nwhip in fear and trembling. At the Bar I have been mildness itself.\\r\\nThe /St. James\\'s Gazette/ speaks of my urbanity, and the courtesy with\\r\\nwhich I have always conducted the most arduous cross-examination. You\\r\\nshould read the /St. James\\'s Gazette/, Lady Caroom. I do not know the\\r\\nbiographical editor, but it is easy to predict a future for him. He has\\r\\ncommon-sense and insight. The paragraph about myself touched me. I\\r\\nhave cut it out, and I mean to keep it always with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Press,\" she said, \"have all those things cut and dried. No doubt\\r\\nif you made friends with that young man he would let you read your\\r\\nobituary notice. I have a friend who has corrected the proofs of his\\r\\nalready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHennibul smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My cousin Avenal, the police magistrate,\" he said, \"actually read his\\r\\nin the Times. He was bathing at Jersey and was carried away by\\r\\ncurrents, and picked up by a Sark fishing-smack. They took him to Sark,\\r\\nand he was so charmed with his surroundings and the hospitality of the\\r\\npeople that he quite forgot to let anybody know where he was. When he\\r\\nread his obituary notice he almost decided to remain dead. He declared\\r\\nthat it was quite impossible to live up to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our charity now-a-days,\" she remarked, \"always begins with the dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me try and awaken yours towards the living!\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you smitten with the Brooks\\' fever?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mine is a fever,\" he answered, \"but it has nothing to do with Brooks.\\r\\nI would try to awaken your charity on behalf of a perfectly worthy\\r\\nobject, myself--/vide/ the /St. James\\'s Gazette/.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what do you need from me more than you have?\" she asked. \"Haven\\'t\\r\\nyou the sole possession of my society, the right to bore me or make me\\r\\nhappy, perhaps presently the right to feed me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For a few minutes,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be so sure. It may be an hour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want it,\" he said, \"for longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething in his tone suddenly broke through the easy lightness of their\\r\\nconversation. She stole a swift side-glance at him, and understood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" she said, \"you and I are setting every one here a bad example.\\r\\nThis is not an occasion for /tete-a-tetes/. We should be doing our duty\\r\\nand talking a little to every one. Let us go back and make up for lost\\r\\ntime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rose to her feet, but found him standing in the way. For once the\\r\\nlong humorous mouth was set fast, his eyes were no longer full of the\\r\\nshadow of laughter, his tone had a new note in it, the note which a\\r\\nwoman never fails to understand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear Lady Caroom,\" he said, \"I was not altogether jesting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked him in the eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear friend,\" she answered, \"I know that you were not, and so I think\\r\\nthat we had better go back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe detained her very gently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is the dearest hope I have in life,\" he said, softly. \"Do not let\\r\\nme run the risk of being misunderstood. Will you be my wife?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head. There were tears in her eyes, but her gesture was\\r\\nsignificant enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is impossible,\" she said. \"I have loved another man all my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe offered her his arm at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I believe,\" he said, in a low tone, \"in the old saying--that a\\r\\nglimpse of paradise is sufficient to blind the strongest man....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey passed into the reception-room, and came face to face with Brooks.\\r\\nShe held out her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, you have no right here,\" she declared. \"You are not even a\\r\\nMember of Parliament.\" He laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What about you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I am an inspiration!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe,\" he said, \"that you realize in the least what is going\\r\\nto happen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do!\" she answered. \"I am going to make you relieve Lord Hennibul,\\r\\nand take me to have an ice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey moved off together. Hennibul stood looking after them for a\\r\\nmoment. Then he sighed and turned slowly away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it\\'s Arranmore,\" he said to himself, \"why on earth doesn\\'t he marry\\r\\nher?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom was more silent than usual. She complained of a headache,\\r\\nand Brooks persuaded her to take champagne instead of the ice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter with you to-night?\" she asked, looking at him\\r\\nthoughtfully. \"You look like a boy--with a dash of the bridegroom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed joyously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You should read the evening papers--you would understand a little the\\r\\npractical effect of our new Tariff Bill. Mills in Yorkshire and\\r\\nLancashire are being opened that have been shut down for years; in\\r\\nMedchester, Northampton, and the boot-centres the unemployed are being\\r\\nswept into the factories. Manufacturers who have been struggling to\\r\\nkeep their places open at all are planning extensions already. The\\r\\nwages bill throughout the country will be the largest next week that has\\r\\nbeen paid for years. Travellers are off to the Colonies with cases of\\r\\nsamples--every manufacturing centre is suddenly alive once more. The\\r\\nterrible struggle for existence is lightened. Next week,\" Brooks\\r\\ncontinued, with an almost boyish twinkle in his eyes, \"I shall go down\\r\\nto Medchester and walk through the streets where it used to make our\\r\\nhearts ache to see the unemployed waiting about like dumb suffering\\r\\ncattle. It will be a holiday--a glorious holiday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet behind it all,\" she remarked, watching him closely, \"there is\\r\\nsomething on your mind. What is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What an observation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Won\\'t you tell me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is only one of the smallest cupboards,\" he said. \"The ghost will\\r\\nvery soon be stifled.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you see Lord Arranmore this evening?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. He was talking to the duke just now. What of him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been watching him. Did you ever see a man look so ill?\",\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is bored,\" Brooks answered, coldly. \"This sort of thing does not\\r\\namuse him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is always the same. He has always that weary look. He is living\\r\\nwith absolute recklessness. It cannot possibly last long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He knows the price,\" Brooks answered. \"He lives as he chooses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder,\" she murmured. \"Sometimes I wonder whether we do not\\r\\nmisjudge him--you and I, Kingston. For you know we have been his\\r\\njudges. You must not shake your head. It is true. You have judged him\\r\\nto be unworthy of a son, and I--I have judged him to be unworthy of a\\r\\nwife. You don\\'t think--that we could possibly have made a mistake--that\\r\\nunderneath there is a little heart left--eaten up with pride and\\r\\nloneliness?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never seen,\" Brooks answered, \"the slightest trace of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor I,\" she answered. \"Yet I knew him when he was young. He was so\\r\\ndifferent, and annihilation is very hard, isn\\'t it? Supposing he were\\r\\nto die, and we were to find out afterwards?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You,\" he said, slowly, \"must be the judge of your own actions. For my\\r\\npart I see in him only the man who abandoned my mother, who spent the\\r\\nmoney of other people in dissipation and worse than dissipation. Who\\r\\ncame to England and accepted my existence after a leisurely interval as\\r\\na matter of course. I have never seen in any one of his actions, or\\r\\nheard in his tone one single indication of anything save selfishness so\\r\\nincarnate as to have become the only moving impulse of his life. If\\r\\never I could believe that he cared for me, would find in me anything\\r\\nsave a convenience, I would try to forget the past. If he would even\\r\\nexpress his sorrow for it, show himself capable of any emotion\\r\\nwhatsoever in connection with anything or any person save himself, I\\r\\nwould be only too thankful to escape from my ridiculous position.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they were silent for a moment, each occupied with their own\\r\\nthoughts, and Lord Arranmore, pale and spare, taller than most men\\r\\nthere, notwithstanding a recently-acquired stoop, came wearily over to\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me,\" he remarked, \"what gloomy faces--and I expected to see Brooks\\r\\nat least radiant. Am I intruding?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be absurd, Arranmore,\" she said kindly. \"Why don\\'t you bring up\\r\\nthat chair and sit down? You look tired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed--a little hardly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been tired so long,\" he said, \"that it has become a habit.\\r\\nBrooks, will you think me guilty of an impertinence, I wonder? I have\\r\\nintruded upon your concerns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks looked up with his eyes full of questioning. \"That fellow\\r\\nLavilette,\" Arranmore continued, seemed worried about your anonymous\\r\\nsubscription. I was in an evil temper yesterday afternoon, and Verity\\r\\namused me. So I wrote and confounded the fellow by explaining that it\\r\\nwas I who sent the money--the thousand pounds you had.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You?\" Lady Caroom exclaimed, breathlessly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You sent me that thousand pounds?\" Brooks cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey exchanged rapid glances: A spot of colour burned in Lady Caroom\\'s\\r\\ncheeks. She felt her heart quicken, an unspoken prayer upon her lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks, too, was agitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" Lord Arranmore remarked, coldly, \"I really don\\'t know\\r\\nwhy my whim should so much astound you. I took care to explain that I\\r\\nsent it without the slightest sympathy in the cause--merely out of\\r\\ncompliment to an acquaintance. It was just a whim, nothing more, I can\\r\\nassure you. I think that I won it at Sandown or something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was not because you were interested in this work, then?\" Lady Caroom\\r\\nasked, fearfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not in the slightest,\" he answered. \"That is to say, sympathetically\\r\\ninterested. I am curious. I will admit that. No more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour faded from Lady Caroom\\'s cheeks. She shivered a little and\\r\\nrose to her feet. Brooks\\' face had hardened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are very much obliged to you for the money,\" he said. \"As for\\r\\nLavilette, I had not thought it worth while to reply to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor should I in your place,\" he answered. \"My position is a little\\r\\ndifferent, of course. I am positively looking forward to my next week\\'s\\r\\nVerity. You are leaving now, I see. Good-night!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have kept Mr. Brooks away from his friends,\" she said, looking at\\r\\nhim. \"Will you see me to my carriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe offered her his arm with courtly grace. They passed down the crowded\\r\\nstaircase together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are looking ill, Philip,\" she said, softly. \"You are not taking\\r\\ncare of yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Care of myself,\" he laughed. \"Why, for whom? Life is not exactly a\\r\\nplayground, is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are not making the best of it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The best! Do you want to mock me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is you,\" she whispered, \"who stand before a looking-glass, and mock\\r\\nyourself. Philip, be a man. Your life is one long repression. Break\\r\\nthrough just once! Won\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sighed. \"Would you have me a hypocrite, Catherine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head. Suddenly she looked up at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Philip, will you promise me this? If ever your impulse should come--if\\r\\nyou should feel the desire to speak, to act once more as a man from\\r\\nyour heart--you will not stifle it. Promise me that.\" He looked at her\\r\\nwith a faint, tired smile. \"Yes, I promise,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY SYBIL LENDS A HAND\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks glanced at the card which was brought in to him, at first\\r\\ncarelessly enough, afterwards with mingled surprise and pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is some one,\" he said to Mary Scott, \"whom I should like you to\\r\\nmeet. Show the young lady in,\" he directed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome instinct seemed to tell her the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is it?\" she asked quickly. \"I am very busy this morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is Lady Sybil Caroom,\" he answered. \"Please don\\'t go. I should\\r\\nlike you to meet her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary looked longingly at the door of communication which led into the\\r\\nfurther suite of offices, but it was too late to think of escape. Sybil\\r\\nhad already entered, bringing into the room a delicious odor of\\r\\nviolets, herself almost bewilderingly beautiful. She was dressed with\\r\\nextreme simplicity, but with a delicate fastidiousness which Mary at any\\r\\nrate was quick to appreciate. Her lips were slightly parted in a\\r\\nnatural and perfectly dazzling smile. She came across to Brooks with\\r\\noutstretched hand and laughter in her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Confess that you are horrified,\" she exclaimed. \"I don\\'t care a bit.\\r\\nI\\'ve waited for you to take me quite long enough. If you won\\'t come now\\r\\nI shall go by myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go where?\" he exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, to one of the branches--I don\\'t care which. I can help for the\\r\\nrest of the day.\" He laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, let me introduce you to Miss Scott,\" he said, turning round.\\r\\n\"Mary, this is Lady Sybil Caroom. Miss Scott,\" he continued, turning to\\r\\nthe younger girl, \"has been my right hand since we first started. If\\r\\never you do stand behind our counter it will have to be under her\\r\\nauspices.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil turned courteously but with some indifference towards the girl,\\r\\nwho was standing by Brooks\\' chair. In her plain black dress and white\\r\\nlinen collar Mary perhaps looked more than her years, especially by the\\r\\nside of Sybil. As the eyes of the two met, Sybil saw that she was\\r\\nregarded with more than ordinary attention. She saw, too, that Mary was\\r\\nneither so plain nor so insignificant as she had at first imagined.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure you are very much to be congratulated, Miss Scott,\" she said.\\r\\n\"Mr. Brooks\\' scheme is a splendid success, isn\\'t it? You must be proud\\r\\nof your share in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My share,\" Mary said, in quiet, even tones, \"has been very small\\r\\nindeed. Mr. Brooks is alone responsible for it. The idea was his, and\\r\\nthe organization was his. We others have been no more than machines.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very useful machines, Mary,\" Brooks said, with a kind glance towards\\r\\nher. \"Come, we mustn\\'t any of us belittle our share in the work.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary took up some papers from the desk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think,\" she said, \"that if you have no more messages for Mr. Flitch\\r\\nI had better start. We are very busy in Stepney just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please don\\'t hurry,\" Brooks said. \"We must try and manage something\\r\\nfor Lady Sybil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary looked up doubtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unless you ask Lady Sybil to look on,\" she said, \"I don\\'t quite see how\\r\\nit is possible for her to come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Sybil knows the conditions,\" Brooks answered. \"She wants to have\\r\\na try as a helper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary raised her eyebrows slightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The chief work in the morning is washing children,\" she remarked.\\r\\n\"They come to us in a perfectly filthy condition, and we wash about\\r\\ntwenty each, altogether.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'m not at all afraid of that,\" she declared. \"I could do my\\r\\nshare. I rather like kiddies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The other departments,\" Mary went on, \"all need some instruction.\\r\\nWould you think it worth while for one day? If so, I should be pleased\\r\\nto do what I can for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil hesitated. She glanced towards Brooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want to give a lot of unnecessary trouble, of course,\" she\\r\\nsaid. \"Especially if you are busy. But it might be for more than one\\r\\nday. You have a staff of supernumerary helpers, haven\\'t you, whom you\\r\\nsend for when you are busy? I thought that I might be one of those.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In that case,\" Mary answered, \"I shall be very glad, of course, to put\\r\\nyou in the way of it. I am going to my own branch this morning at\\r\\nStepney. Will you come with me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you are sure I shan\\'t be a nuisance,\" Sybil answered, gratefully.\\r\\n\"Good-bye, Mr. Brooks. I\\'m awfully obliged to you, and will talk it\\r\\nall over at the Henages\\' to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two girls drove off in Sybil\\'s brougham. Mary, in her quiet little\\r\\nhat and plain jacket, seemed to her companion, notwithstanding her air\\r\\nof refinement, to be a denizen of some other world. And between the two\\r\\nthere was from the first a certain amount of restraint.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you give up your whole time to this sort of work?\" Sybil asked,\\r\\npresently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do now,\" Mary answered. \"I had other employment in the morning, but\\r\\nI gave that up last week. I am a salaried official of the Society from\\r\\nlast Monday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil stole a swift side-glance at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, I think that it must be a very satisfactory sort of life,\"\\r\\nshe said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s lips flickered into the faintest of smiles. \"Really!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I mean it,\" Sybil continued. \"Of course, I like going about and\\r\\nenjoying myself, but it is hideously tiring. And then after a year or\\r\\ntwo of it you begin to realize a sort of sameness. Things lose their\\r\\nflavour. Then you have odd times of serious thought, and you know that\\r\\nyou have just been going round and round in a circle, that you have done\\r\\nnothing at all except made some show at enjoying yourself. Now that\\r\\nisn\\'t very satisfactory, is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" Mary answered, \"I don\\'t suppose it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now you,\" Sybil continued, \"you may be dull sometimes, but I don\\'t\\r\\nsuppose you are, and whenever you leave off and think--well, you must\\r\\nalways feel that your time, instead of having been wasted, has been well\\r\\nand wholesomely spent. I wish I could have that feeling sometimes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite herself, Mary felt that she would have to like this girl. She\\r\\nwas so pretty, so natural, and so deeply in earnest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is no reason why you shouldn\\'t, is there?\" she said, more kindly\\r\\nthan she had as yet spoken. \"I can assure you that I very often have\\r\\nthe blues, and I don\\'t consider mine by any means the happiest sort of\\r\\nlife. But, of course, one feels differently a little if one has tried\\r\\nto do something--and you can if you like, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil\\'s face was perfectly brilliant with smiles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You think that I can?\" she exclaimed. \"How nice of you. I don\\'t mind\\r\\nhow hard it is at first. I may be a little awkward, but I don\\'t think\\r\\nI\\'m stupid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You think this sort of work is the sort you would like best?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, yes. It seems so practical, you know,\" Sybil declared. \"You must\\r\\nbe doing good, even if some of the people don\\'t deserve it. I don\\'t\\r\\nknow about the washing, but I don\\'t mind it a bit. Do you think it will\\r\\nbe a busy morning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure it will,\" Mary answered. \"A number of the people are getting\\r\\nto work again now, since the Tariff Revision Bill passed, and they keep\\r\\ncoming to us for clothes and boots and things. I shall give you the\\r\\nskirts and blouses to look after as soon as the washing is over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Delightful,\" Sybil exclaimed. \"I am sure I can manage that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And on no account must you give any money to any one,\" Mary said.\\r\\n\"That is most important.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will remember,\" Sybil promised.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo hours later she broke in upon her mother and half-a-dozen callers,\\r\\nher hat obviously put on without a looking-glass, her face flushed, and\\r\\nher hair disordered, and smelling strongly of disinfectant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some tea, mother, please,\" she exclaimed, nodding to her visitors. \"I\\r\\nhave had one bun for luncheon, and I am starving. Can you imagine what\\r\\nI have been doing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one could. Every one tried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Skating!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ping-pong!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting theatre-tickets at the theatre! She waved them aside with\\r\\nscorn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have washed fourteen children,\" she declared, impressively, \"fitted\\r\\nat least a dozen women with blouses and skirts, and three with boots.\\r\\nBesides a lot of odd things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore set down his cup with a little shrug of the shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have joined Brooks\\' Society?\" he remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes! I have been down at the Stepney branch all the morning. And do\\r\\nyou know, we\\'re disinfected before we leave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A most necessary precaution, I should think,\" Lady Caroom exclaimed,\\r\\nreaching for her vinaigrette, \"but do go and change your things as\\r\\nquickly as you can.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must eat, mother, or starve,\" Sybil declared. \"I have never been so\\r\\nhungry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA somewhat ponderous lady, who was the wife of a bishop, felt bound to\\r\\nexpress her disapprobation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you really think, dear,\" she said, \"that you are wise in encouraging\\r\\na charity which is not in any way under the control of the Church?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, isn\\'t it?\" Sybil remarked. \"I\\'m sure I didn\\'t know. But then the\\r\\nChurch hasn\\'t anything quite like this, has it? Mr. Brooks is so\\r\\nclever and original in all his ideas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disapprobation of the bishop\\'s wife became even more marked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The very fact,\" she said, \"that the Church has not thought it wise to\\r\\ninstitute a charitable scheme upon such--er--sweeping lines, is a proof,\\r\\nto my mind, that the whole thing is a mistake. As a matter of fact, I\\r\\nhappen to know that the bishop strongly disapproves of Mr. Brooks\\'\\r\\nmethods.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s rather a pity, isn\\'t it?\" Sybil asked, sweetly. \"The Society\\r\\nhas done so much good, and in so short a time. Every one admits that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that the opinion is very far from universal,\" the elder lady\\r\\nremarked, firmly. \"There appears to be no discrimination shown whatever\\r\\nin the distribution of relief. The deserving and the undeserving are\\r\\nall classed together. I could not possibly approve of any charity\\r\\nconducted upon such lines, nor, I think, could any good churchwoman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Brooks thinks,\" Sybil remarked, with her mouth full of cake, \"that\\r\\nit is the undeserving who are in the greatest need of help.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One could believe anything,\" the bishop\\'s wife said stiffly, \"of a man\\r\\nwho adopted such principles as that. And although I do not as a rule\\r\\napprove of Mr. Lavilette or his paper, I am seriously inclined to agree\\r\\nwith him in some of his strictures upon Mr. Brooks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil laughed softly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hadn\\'t read them,\" she remarked. \"Mother doesn\\'t allow the man\\'s\\r\\npaper in the house. Do you really mean that you have it at the palace,\\r\\nMrs. Endicott?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bishop\\'s wife stiffened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Lavilette has at times done great service to the community by his\\r\\nexposure of frauds of all sorts, especially charitable frauds,\" she\\r\\nsaid. \"It is possible that he may shortly add to the number.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore shook his head slowly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Lavilette,\" he said, \"has also had to pay damages in one or two\\r\\nrather expensive libel cases. And, between you and me, Mrs. Endicott,\\r\\nif our young friend Brooks chose to move in the matter, I am afraid Mr.\\r\\nLavilette might have to sign the largest cheque he has ever signed in\\r\\nhis life for law costs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bishop\\'s wife rose with an icy smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I seem to have found my way into Mr. Brooks\\' headquarters,\" she\\r\\nremarked. \"Lady Caroom, I shall hope to see you at the palace shortly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor me,\" Sybil exclaimed, as their visitor departed. \"She only asked\\r\\nyou, mummy, so as to exclude me. And poor Mr. Brooks! I wish he\\'d\\r\\nbeen here. What fun we should have had.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, these Etrusians,\" Lord Arranmore murmured. \"I thought that a\\r\\nbishop was very near heaven indeed, all sanctity and charity, and that a\\r\\nbishop\\'s wife was the concentrated essence of these things--plus the\\r\\nwings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil laughed softly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sanctity and charity,\" she repeated, \"and Mrs. Endicott. Oh!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RESERVATION OF MARY SCOTT\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two girls were travelling westwards on the outside of an omnibus, in\\r\\nitself to Sybil a most fascinating mode of progression, and talking a\\r\\ngood deal spasmodically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s really too bad of you, Miss Scott,\" Sybil declared. \"Now to-day,\\r\\nif you will come, luncheon shall be served in my own room. We shall be\\r\\nquite cosy and quiet, and I promise you that you shall not see a soul\\r\\nexcept my mother--whom I want you to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t think me unkind,\" she said. \"I really must not begin visiting.\\r\\nI have only just time for a hurried lunch, and then I must look in at\\r\\nthe office and get down to Bermondsey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You might just as well have that hurried lunch with me,\" Sybil\\r\\ndeclared. \"I\\'ll send you anywhere you like afterwards in the carriage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very kind of you,\" Mary answered, \"but my visiting days are over.\\r\\nI am not a social person at all, you know. My role is usefulness, and\\r\\nnothing else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are too young to talk like that,\" Sybil said. \"I am ten years\\r\\nolder than you are,\" Mary reminded her. \"You are twenty-eight,\" Sybil\\r\\nanswered. \"I think it is beautiful of you to be so devoted to this\\r\\nwork, but I am quite sure a little change now and then is wholesome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In another ten years I may think of it,\" Mary said. \"Just now I have\\r\\nso much upon my hands that I dare not risk even the slightest\\r\\ndistraction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In another ten years,\" Sybil said, \"you will find it more difficult to\\r\\nenlarge your life than now. I can\\'t believe that absorption in any one\\r\\nthing is natural at your age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary looked steadfastly down at the horses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must all decide what is best for ourselves,\" she said. \"I have not\\r\\nyour disposition, remember.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing in the world,\" Sybil said, \"would convince me that it is well\\r\\nfor any girl of your age to crowd everything out of her life except\\r\\nwork, however fine and useful the work may be. Now you have admitted\\r\\nthat except for Mr. Brooks and the people you have met in connection\\r\\nwith his work you have no friends in London. I want you to count me a\\r\\nfriend, Miss Scott. You have been very kind to me, and made everything\\r\\ndelightfully easy. Why can\\'t you let me try and repay it a little?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have only done my duty,\" Mary answered, quietly. \"I am supposed to\\r\\nshow new helpers what to do, and you have picked it up very quickly. And\\r\\nas for the rest--don\\'t think me unkind, but I have no room for\\r\\nfriendships in my life just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry,\" Sybil answered, softly, for though Mary\\'s tone had been\\r\\ncold enough, she had nevertheless for a single moment lifted the\\r\\ncurtain, and Sybil understood in some vague manner that there were\\r\\nthings behind into which she had no right to inquire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two girls parted at Trafalgar Square, and Sybil, still in love with\\r\\nthe fresh air, turned blithely westward on foot. In the Haymarket she\\r\\ncame face to face with Brooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe greeted her with a delightful smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You alone, and walking,\" he exclaimed. \"What fortune. May I come?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course,\" she answered. \"You know where I have come from, I\\r\\nsuppose?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced at her plain clothes and realized that the odour of\\r\\ndisinfectants was stronger even than the perfume of the handful of\\r\\nviolets which she had just bought from a woman in the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stepney!\" he exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite right. I had a card last evening, and was there at nine o\\'clock\\r\\nthis morning. I suppose I look a perfect wreck. I was dancing at\\r\\nHamilton House at three o\\'clock.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked towards her marvelling. Her cheeks were prettily flushed, and\\r\\nshe walked with the delightful springiness of perfect health.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never seen you look better,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you,\" she remarked, glancing in amusement at his blue serge\\r\\nclothes, which, to tell the truth, badly needed brushing. \"What are you\\r\\ndoing in the West End at this time in the morning?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been to Drury Lane,\" he answered, \"with some surveyors from the\\r\\nCounty Council. There is a whole court there I mean to get condemned.\\r\\nThen I looked in at our new place there, but there was such a howling\\r\\nlot of children that I was glad to get away. How they hate being\\r\\nwashed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t they!\" she exclaimed, laughing. \"I had the dearest, naughtiest\\r\\nlittle girl this morning, and, do you know, when I got her clean, her\\r\\nown brothers and sisters didn\\'t know her again. I\\'m so glad I\\'ve seen\\r\\nyou, Mr. Brooks. I want to ask you something.\" \"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About Miss Scott. She\\'s been so good to me, and I like her awfully.\\r\\nWe\\'ve just come up on the omnibus together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has been my right hand from the very first,\" Brooks said, slowly.\\r\\n\"I really don\\'t see how I could have done without her. She is such a\\r\\ncapital organizer, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know all that,\" Sybil declared. \"She\\'s wonderful. I don\\'t want, of\\r\\ncourse, to be inquisitive,\" she went on, after a moment\\'s hesitation,\\r\\n\"but she interests me so much, and it was only this morning that I felt\\r\\nthat I understood her a little bit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a very reserved young woman,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but isn\\'t there some reason for it?\" Sybil continued, eagerly. \"I\\r\\nhave asked her lots of times to come and see me. She admits that she\\r\\nhas no friends in London, and I wanted to have her come very much. You\\r\\nsee, I thought she would be sure to like mother, and if she doesn\\'t care\\r\\nfor society, we might go to the theatre or the opera, a it would be a\\r\\nlittle change for her, wouldn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think it is very kind of you indeed,\" Brooks said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, she has always refused, but I have been very persistent. I just\\r\\nthought that she was perhaps a little shy, or found it difficult to\\r\\nbreak through her retirement--people get like that, you know, when they\\r\\nlive alone. So this morning I really went for her, and I happened to be\\r\\nlooking, and I saw something in her face which puzzled me. It stopped\\r\\nmy asking her any more. There is something underneath her quiet manner\\r\\nand self-devotion. She has had trouble of some sort.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you know?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A girl can always tell,\" Sybil answered. \"Her self-control is\\r\\nwonderful, but she just let it slip--for a moment. She has some\\r\\ntrouble, I am sure. I thought perhaps you might know. Isn\\'t there\\r\\nanything we could do? I am so sorry for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks was very grave, and his face was curiously pale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you quite sure?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked on in silence for a few moments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have asked me a very difficult question,\" he said at last. \"She\\r\\nhas had a very unhappy sort of life. Her father and mother died in\\r\\nCanada--her father shot himself, and her mother died of the shock. She\\r\\nwent to live with an uncle at Medchester, who was good to her, but his\\r\\nhousehold could scarcely have been very congenial. I met her there--she\\r\\nwas interested in charitable works then, and she came to London to try\\r\\nand attain some sort of independence. At first she had a position on a\\r\\nlady\\'s magazine which took up her mornings, but we have just induced her\\r\\nto accept a small salary and give us all her time.\" \"That seems like a\\r\\ncomprehensive sketch of her life,\" Sybil remarked, thoughtfully, \"but\\r\\nare you sure--that you have not missed anything out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So far as I know,\" he answered, gravely, \"there is nothing new to\\r\\ntell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked the rest of the way to Berkeley Square in absolute silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will come in to lunch?\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked down at his clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think not,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are almost certain to be alone,\" she said. \"You haven\\'t seen mother\\r\\nfor a long time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe suffered himself to be persuaded, and almost immediately regretted\\r\\nit. For there were a dozen people or more round the luncheon-table, and\\r\\nhe caught a glimpse of more than one frock coat. Further, from the dead\\r\\nsilence which followed their entrance, it seemed more than probable that\\r\\nhe himself had formed the subject of conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom greeted him as kindly as ever, and found a place for him by\\r\\nher side. Brooks, whose self-possession seldom failed him, smiled to\\r\\nhimself as he recognized the bishop, who was his /vis-a-vis/. Hennibul,\\r\\nhowever, from a little lower down nodded to him pleasantly, and Lord\\r\\nArranmore spoke a few words of dry greeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your friend Bullsom,\" he remarked, \"has soon distinguished himself.\\r\\nHe made quite a decent speech the other night on the Tariff Bill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has common-sense and assurance,\" Brooks answered. \"He ought to be a\\r\\nvery useful man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Hennibul leaned forward and addressed Arranmore with blank surprise\\r\\non his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t mean to say that you read the debates in the House of\\r\\nCommons, Arranmore?\" he exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Since the degeneration of English humour,\" he remarked, \"one must go\\r\\nsomewhere for one\\'s humour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should try the House of Lords, then,\" a smart young under-secretary\\r\\nremarked under his breath, with a glance at the bishop. \"There is more\\r\\nhidden humour in the unshaken gravity of the Episcopal Bench than in\\r\\nboth Houses of Parliament put together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They take themselves so seriously,\" Sybil murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To our friend there,\" the younger man continued, \"the whole world\\'s a\\r\\ncongregation--and, by Jove, here comes the text.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the bishop had deliberately cleared his throat, and leaning forward\\r\\naddressed Brooks across the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe,\" he said, \"that I have the pleasure of speaking to Mr.\\r\\nBrooks--Mr. Kingston Brooks?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is my name,\" Brooks answered civilly, wondering what avalanche was\\r\\nto be hurled upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you consider a question, almost a personal question, from a\\r\\nstranger an impertinence--when the stranger is twice your age?\" the\\r\\nbishop asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By no means,\" Brooks answered. \"On the contrary, I should be delighted\\r\\nto answer it if I can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These aspersions which Mr.--er--Lavilette has been making so freely in\\r\\nhis paper against your new departure--I mean against the financial\\r\\nmanagement of it--do you propose to answer them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" Brooks said, \"I have not altogether made up my mind. Perhaps\\r\\nyour lordship would permit me--since you have mentioned the matter--to\\r\\nask for your advice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bishop inclined his head. This was by no means the truculent sort\\r\\nof young man he had expected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very welcome to it, Mr. Brooks,\" he answered. \"I should\\r\\nadvise you most earnestly to at once justify yourself,--not to Mr.\\r\\nLavilette, but to the readers of his paper whom he may have influenced\\r\\nby his statements. One charitable institution, however different its\\r\\nfoundation, or its method of working, or its ultimate aims, leans\\r\\nlargely upon another. Mr. Lavilette\\'s attack, if unanswered, may\\r\\naffect the public mind with regard to many other organizations which are\\r\\ngrievously in need of support.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If that is your opinion,\" Brooks said, after a moment\\'s hesitation, \"I\\r\\nwill take the steps you suggest, and set myself right at once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you can do that thoroughly and clearly,\" the bishop said, \"you will\\r\\nrender a service to the whole community.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There should not be much difficulty,\" Brooks remarked, helping himself\\r\\nto omelette. \"I never appealed for subscriptions, but directly they\\r\\nbegan to come in I engaged a clerk and a well-known firm of auditors,\\r\\nthrough whose banking-account all the money has passed. They have been\\r\\nonly too anxious to take the matter up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am more than pleased at your decision, Mr. Brooks,\" the bishop said,\\r\\ngenially. \"I rejoice at it. You will pardon my remarking that you seem\\r\\nvery young to have inaugurated and to carry the whole responsibility of\\r\\na work of such magnitude.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The work,\" Brooks answered, \"has largely grown of itself. But I have\\r\\nan excellent staff of helpers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The sole responsibility though rests with you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am arranging to evade it,\" Brooks answered. \"I am going to adopt\\r\\ncommercial methods and inaugurate a Board of Directors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bishop hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Again, Mr. Brooks,\" he said, \"I must address a suggestion to you which\\r\\nmight seem to require an apology. You have adopted methods and\\r\\nexpressed views with regard to your scheme which are in themselves\\r\\nscarcely reconcilable with the point of view with which we churchmen are\\r\\nbound to regard the same question. But if you thought it worth while\\r\\nbefore finally arranging your Board to discuss the whole subject with\\r\\nme, it would give me the greatest pleasure to have you visit me at the\\r\\npalace at any time convenient to yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall consider it a great privilege,\" Brooks answered, promptly, \"and\\r\\nI shall not hesitate to avail myself of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little party broke up soon afterwards, but Lady Caroom touched\\r\\nBrooks upon his shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come into my room for a few minutes,\" she said. \"I want to talk with\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\nFATHER AND SON\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know,\" Lady Caroom said, motioning Brooks to a seat by her side,\\r\\n\"that I feel very middle-class and elderly and interfering. For I am\\r\\ngoing to talk to you about Sybil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks was a little paler than usual. This was one of those rare\\r\\noccasions when he found his emotions very hard to subdue. And it had\\r\\ncome so suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After we left Enton,\" Lady Caroom said, thoughtfully, \"I noticed a\\r\\ndistinct change in her. The first evidences of it were in her treatment\\r\\nof Sydney Molyneux. I am quite sure that she purposely precipitated\\r\\nmatters, and when he proposed refused him definitely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not think,\" Brooks found voice to say, \"that she would ever have\\r\\nmarried Sydney Molyneux.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps not,\" Lady Caroom admitted, \"but at any rate before our visit\\r\\nto Enton she was quite content to have him around--she was by no means\\r\\neager to make up her mind definitely. After we left she seemed to\\r\\ndeliberately plan to dispose of him finally. Since then--I am talking\\r\\nin confidence, Kingston-she has refused t e Duke of Atherstone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks was silent. His self-control was being severely tested. His\\r\\nheart was beating like a sledgehammer--he was very anxious to avoid Lady\\r\\nCaroom\\'s eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Atherstone,\" she said, slowly, \"is quite the most eligible bachelor in\\r\\nEngland, and he is, as you know, a very nice, unaffected boy. There is\\r\\nonly one possible inference for me, as Sybil\\'s mother, to draw, and that\\r\\nis that she cares, or is beginning to think that she cares, for some one\\r\\nelse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some one else? Do you know whom?\" Brooks asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you do not know,\" Lady Caroom answered, \"I do not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks threw aside all attempt at disguise. He looked across at Lady\\r\\nCaroom, and his eyes were very bright.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never believed,\" he said, \"that Sybil would be likely to care\\r\\nfor me. I can scarcely believe it now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In any case,\" she said, \"could you ask her to marry you? You must see\\r\\nthat as things are it would be impossible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible!\" he muttered. \"Impossible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course,\" she answered, briskly. \"You must be a man of the world\\r\\nenough to know that. You could not ask a girl in Sybil\\'s position to\\r\\nshare a borrowed name, nor would the other conditions permit of your\\r\\nmarrying her. That is why I want to talk to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is there any immediate chance of your reconciliation with the Marquis\\r\\nof Arranmore?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None,\" Brooks answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" Lady Caroom said, \"there is no immediate chance of your\\r\\nbeing in a position to marry Sybil. Don\\'t look at me as though I were\\r\\nsaying unkind things. I am not. I am only talking common-sense. What\\r\\nis your income?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About two thousand pounds, but some of that half, perhaps more--goes to\\r\\nthe Society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly. It would be impossible for you to marry Sybil on the whole of\\r\\nit, or twice the whole of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You want me then,\" Brooks said, \"to be reconciled to my father. Yet\\r\\nyou--you yourself will not trust him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not expressed any wish of the sort,\" Lady Caroom said, kindly.\\r\\n\"I only wished to point out that as things are you were not in a\\r\\nposition to ask Sybil to marry you, and therefore I want you to keep\\r\\naway from her. I mean this kindly for both of you. Of course if Sybil\\r\\nis absolutely in earnest, if the matter has gone too far, we must talk\\r\\nit all over again and see what is to be done. But I want you to give\\r\\nher a chance. Keep away for a time. Your father may live for\\r\\ntwenty-five years. If your relations with him all that time continue as\\r\\nthey are now, marriage with a girl brought up like Sybil would be an\\r\\nimpossibility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks was silent for several moments. Then he looked up suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has Lady Sybil said anything to you--which led you to speak to me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. She is very young, you know. Frankly, I do not believe that she\\r\\nknows her own mind. You have not spoken to her, of course?\" \"No!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you will not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose,\" Brooks said, \"that I must not think of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must give up thinking about her, of course,\" Lady Caroom said,\\r\\n\"until--\" Until what?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Until you can ask her--if ever you do ask her--to marry you in your\\r\\nproper name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks set his teeth and walked up and down the little room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That,\" he said, \"may be never.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" Lady Caroom agreed. \"That is why I am suggesting that you do\\r\\nnot see her so often.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped opposite her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does he--does Lord Arranmore know anything of this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not from me. He may have heard whispers. To tell you the truth, I\\r\\nmyself have been asked questions during the last few days. You have\\r\\nbeen seen about a good deal with Sybil, and you are rather a mystery to\\r\\npeople. That is why I felt compelled to speak.\" He nodded. \"I see!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must not blame me,\" she went on, softly. \"You know, Kingston, that\\r\\nI like you, that I would give you Sybil willingly under ordinary\\r\\ncircumstances. I don\\'t want to speak to her if I can help it. And,\\r\\nKingston, there is one thing more I must say to you. It is on my mind.\\r\\nIt keeps me awake at night. I think that it will make an old woman of\\r\\nme very soon. If--if we should be wrong?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is no possibility of that,\" he answered, sadly. \"Lord Arranmore\\r\\nis candour itself, even in his selfishness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His face haunts me,\" she murmured. \"There is something so terribly\\r\\nimpersonal, so terribly sad about it. He looks on at everything, he\\r\\njoins in nothing. They say that he gambles, but he never knows whether\\r\\nhe is winning or losing. He gives entertainments that are historical,\\r\\nand remains as cold as ice to guests whom a prince would be glad to\\r\\nwelcome. His horse won that great race the other day, and he gave up\\r\\nhis place on the stand, just before the start, to a little girl, and\\r\\nnever even troubled to watch the race, though his winnings were\\r\\nenormous. He bought the Frivolity Theatre, produced this new farce, and\\r\\nhas never been seen inside the place. What does it mean, Kingston?\\r\\nThere must be suffering behind all this--terrible suffering.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a law of retribution,\" Brooks said, coldly. \"He has made other\\r\\npeople suffer all his life. Now perhaps his turn has come. He spends\\r\\nfortunes trying to amuse himself and cannot. Are we to pity him for\\r\\nthat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard of people,\" she said, looking at him intently, \"who are\\r\\ntoo proud to show the better part of themselves, who rather than court\\r\\npity or even sympathy will wear a mask always, will hide the good that\\r\\nis in them and parade the bad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You love him still?\" he said, wonderingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kingston, I do. If I were a brave woman I would risk everything.\\r\\nSometimes when I see him, like a Banquo at a feast, with his eyes full\\r\\nof weariness and the mummy\\'s smile upon his lips, I feel that I can keep\\r\\naway no longer. Kingston, let us go to him, you and I. Let us see if we\\r\\ncan\\'t tear off the mask.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He would laugh at us!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you try?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! But, Lady Caroom, you have no such debt of bitterness against him\\r\\nas I have. I cannot advise you--I would not dare. But if there is a\\r\\nspark of soul left in the man, such love as yours must fan it into\\r\\nwarmth. If you have the courage--risk it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks left without seeing Sybil again, and turned northward. In Pall\\r\\nMall he heard his name called from the steps of one of the great clubs.\\r\\nHe looked up and found Lord Arranmore leisurely descending.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A word with you, Brooks,\" he said, coolly, \"on a matter of business.\\r\\nWill you step inside?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks hesitated. It was beginning to rain, and neither of them had\\r\\numbrellas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As you will,\" he answered. \"I have an appointment in half-an-hour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not detain you ten minutes,\" Lord Arranmore answered. \"There\\r\\nis a comfortable strangers\\' room here where we can chat. Will you have\\r\\nanything?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing to drink, thanks,\" Brooks answered. \"A cigarette, if you are\\r\\ngoing to smoke.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Arranmore pushed his cigarette-case across the small round table\\r\\nwhich stood between their easy-chairs. The room was empty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will find these tolerable. I promised to be brief, did I not? I\\r\\nwished to speak for a moment upon a subject which it seems to me might\\r\\nrequire a readjustment of our financial relations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks looked up puzzled but made no remark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I refer to the possibility of your desiring to marry. Be so good as not\\r\\nto interrupt me. I have seen you once or twice with Sybil Caroom, and\\r\\nthere has been a whisper--but after all that is of no consequence. The\\r\\nname of the young lady would be no concern of mine. But in case you\\r\\nshould be contemplating anything of the sort, I thought it as well that\\r\\nyou should know what the usual family arrangements are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry,\" Brooks said, \"but I really don\\'t understand what you mean\\r\\nby family arrangements.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\" Lord Arranmore remarked, softly. \"Perhaps if you would allow me\\r\\nto explain--it is your own time which is limited, you know. The eldest\\r\\nson of our family comes in, as you have been told, on his twenty-first\\r\\nbirthday, to two thousand pounds a year, which income you are now in\\r\\npossession of. On his marriage that is increased to ten thousand a\\r\\nyear, with the possession of either Enton or Mangohfred. in the present\\r\\ncase you could take your choice, as I am perfectly indifferent which I\\r\\nretain. That is all I wished to say. I thought it best for you to\\r\\nunderstand the situation. Mr. Ascough will, at any time, put it into\\r\\nlegal shape for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You speak of this--arrangement,\" Brooks said, slowly, \"as though it\\r\\nwere a corroboration of the settlement upon the eldest son. This\\r\\nscarcely seems possible. There can be no such provision legally.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I scarcely see,\" Lord Arranmore said, wearily, \"what that has to do\\r\\nwith it, The ten thousand pounds a year is, of course, not a legal\\r\\ncharge upon the estates. But from time immemorial it has been the\\r\\namount which has been the admitted portion of the eldest son upon\\r\\nmarriage. It is no gift from me. It is the income due to Lord Kingston\\r\\nof Ross. If you wish for any future explanation I must really refer you\\r\\nto Mr. Ascough. The discussion of business details is by no means a\\r\\nfavourite occupation of mine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks rose to his feet. His eyes were fixed steadily, almost longingly\\r\\nupon Lord Arranmore\\'s. His manner was not wholly free from nervousness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very much obliged to you, Lord Arranmore,\" he said. \"I quite\\r\\nunderstand that you are making me the offer of a princely settlement out\\r\\nof the Arranmore estates to which I have no manner of claim. It is not\\r\\npossible for me to accept it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a moment\\'s silence. A great clock in the corner ticked\\r\\nnoisily. A faint unusual colour stole into Lord Arranmore\\'s cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Accept it! I accord you no favour, I offer you no gift. The allowance\\r\\nis, I repeat, one which every Lord Kingston has drawn upon his marriage.\\r\\nPerhaps I have spoken before it was necessary. You may have had no\\r\\nthoughts of anything of the sort?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks did not answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have noticed,\" Lord Arranmore continued in measured tones, \"an\\r\\nintimacy between you and Lady Sybil Caroom, which suggested the idea to\\r\\nme. I look upon Lady Sybil as one of the most charming young\\r\\ngentlewomen of our time, and admirably suited in all respects to the\\r\\nposition of the future Marchioness of Arranmore. I presume that as\\r\\nhead of the family I am within my rights in so far expressing my\\r\\nopinion?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marriage,\" Brooks said, huskily, \"is not possible for me at present.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot accept this money from you. The terms on which we are do not\\r\\nallow of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an ominous glitter in Lord Arranmore\\'s eyes. He, too, rose to\\r\\nhis feet, and remained facing Brooks, his hand upon the back of his\\r\\nchair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you serious? Do you mean that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do!\" Brooks answered. Lord Arranmore pointed to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then be off,\" he said, a note of passion at last quivering in his tone.\\r\\n\"Leave this room at once, and let me see as little of you in the future\\r\\nas possible. If Sybil cares for you, God help her! You are a damned\\r\\nobstinate young prig, sir. Be off!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks walked out of the club and into the street, his ears tingling and\\r\\nhis cheeks aflame. The world seemed topsy-turvy. It was long indeed\\r\\nbefore he forgot those words, which seemed to come to him winged with\\r\\na wonderful and curious force.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVICE OF MR. BULLSOM\\r\\n\\r\\nAt no time in his life was Brooks conscious of so profound a feeling of\\r\\ndissatisfaction with regard to himself, his work, and his judgment, as\\r\\nduring the next few weeks. His friendship with Mary Scott, which had\\r\\nbeen a more pleasant thing than he had ever realized, seemed to him to\\r\\nbe practically at an end, he had received a stinging rebuke from the one\\r\\nman in the world whose right to administer it he would have vigorously\\r\\ndenied, and he was forced to admit to himself that his last few weeks\\r\\nhad been spent in a fool\\'s paradise, into which he ought never to have\\r\\nventured. He had the feeling of having been pulled up sharply in the\\r\\nmidst of a very delightful interlude--and the whole thing seemed to him\\r\\nto come as a warning against any deviation whatsoever from the life\\r\\nwhich he had marked out for himself. So, after a day of indecision and\\r\\nnerveless hesitation, he turned back once more to his work. Here, at\\r\\nany rate, he could find absorption.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe formed his Board--without figure-heads, wholly of workers. There was\\r\\nscarcely a name which any one had ever heard of before. He had his\\r\\ninterview with the bishop, who was shocked at his views, and publicly\\r\\npronounced his enterprise harmful and pauperizing, and Verity, with the\\r\\nnames of the Board as a new weapon, came for him more vehemently than\\r\\never. Brooks, at last goaded into action, sent the paper to his\\r\\nsolicitors and went down to Medchester to attend a dinner given to Mr.\\r\\nBullsom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at Medchester that he recovered his spirits. He knew the place\\r\\nso well that it was easy for him to gauge and appreciate the altered\\r\\nstate of affairs there. The centre of the town was swept clean at last\\r\\nof those throngs of weary-faced men and youths looking for a job, the\\r\\nfactories were running full time-there seemed to his fancy to be even an\\r\\nadded briskness in the faces and the footsteps of the hurrying crowds of\\r\\npeople. Later on at the public dinner which he had come down to attend,\\r\\nhe was amply assured as to the sudden wave of prosperity which was\\r\\npassing over the whole country. Mr. Bullsom, with an immense expanse\\r\\nof white shirt, a white waistcoat and a scarlet camellia in his\\r\\nbutton-hole, beamed and oozed amiability upon every one. Brooks he\\r\\ngrasped by both hands with a full return to his old cordiality,\\r\\nindulgence in which he had rather avoided since he had been aware of the\\r\\nsocial gulf between them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Brooks,\" he said, \"I owe this to you. It was your suggestion. And I\\r\\ndon\\'t think it\\'s turned out so badly, eh? What do you think?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that you have found your proper sphere,\" Brooks answered,\\r\\nsmiling. \"I can\\'t think why you ever needed me to suggest it to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My boy, I can\\'t either,\" Mr. Bullsom declared. \"This is one of the\\r\\nproudest nights of my life. Do you know what we\\'ve done up there at\\r\\nWestminster, eh? We\\'ve given this old country a new lease of life. How\\r\\nthey were all laughing at us up their sleeve, eh! Germans, and\\r\\nFrenchmen, and Yankees. It\\'s a horse of another colour now. John Bull\\r\\nhas found out how to protect himself. And, Brooks, my boy, it\\'s been\\r\\nmentioned to-night, and I\\'m a proud man when I think of it. There were\\r\\nothers who did the showy part of the work, of course, the speechmaking\\r\\nand the bill-framing and all that, but I was the first man to set the\\r\\nProtection snowball rolling. It wasn\\'t much I had to say, but I said\\r\\nit. A glass of wine with you, Sir Henry? With pleasure, sir!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder how long it will last,\" Brooks\\' neighbour remarked, cynically.\\r\\n\"The manufacturers are like a lot of children with a new toy. What\\r\\nabout the Colonies? What are they going to say about it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have no Colonies,\" Brooks answered, smiling. \"You are only half an\\r\\nImperialist. Don\\'t you know that they have been incorporated in the\\r\\nBritish Empire?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hope they\\'ll like it,\" his neighbour remarked, sardonically. \"Plenty\\r\\nof glory and a good price to pay for it. What licks me is that every\\r\\none seems to imagine that this Tariff Bill is going to give the\\r\\nworking-classes a leg-up. To my mind it\\'s the capitalist who\\'s going to\\r\\nscore by it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The capitalist manufacturer,\" Brooks answered. \"But after all you\\r\\ncan\\'t under our present conditions dissociate capital and labour. The\\r\\nbenefit of one will be the benefit of the other. No food stuffs are\\r\\ntaxed, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis neighbour grunted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pity Cobden\\'s ghost can\\'t come and listen to the rot those fellows are\\r\\ntalking,\" he remarked. \"We shall see in a dozen years how the thing\\r\\nworks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dinner ended with a firework of speeches, and an ovation to their\\r\\npopular townsman and member, which left Mr. Bullsom very red in the\\r\\nface and a little watery about the eyes. Brooks and he drove off\\r\\ntogether afterwards, and Mr. Bullsom occupied the first five minutes or\\r\\nso of the journey with a vigorous mopping of his cheeks and forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great night, Brooks,\" he exclaimed, faintly. \"A night to remember.\\r\\nDon\\'t mind admitting that I\\'m more than a bit exhausted though. Phew!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks laughed, and leaning forward looked out of the windows of the\\r\\ncarriage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are we going in the right direction?\" he asked. \"This isn\\'t the way to\\r\\n\\'Homelands.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Little surprise for you, Brooks!\" he remarked. \"We found the sort of\\r\\nplace the girls were hankering after, to let furnished, and we\\'ve took\\r\\nit for a year. We moved in a fortnight ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do I know the house?\" Brooks asked. \"It\\'s Woton Hall,\" Mr. Bullsom\\r\\nremarked, impressively. \"Nice old place. Dare say you remember it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember it! Of course I do,\" Brooks answered. \"How do the young\\r\\nladies like it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom laid hold of the strap of the carriage. The road was\\r\\nrough, the horses were fresh, and Mr. Bullsom\\'s head had felt steadier.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" Mr. Bullsom said, \"you\\'d think to hear em we\\'d stepped\\r\\nstraight into heaven. We\\'re close to the barracks, you know, and I\\'m\\r\\nblest if half the officers haven\\'t called already. They drop in to\\r\\nluncheon, or dinner, or whatever\\'s going on, in the most friendly way,\\r\\njust as they used to, you know, when Sir Henry lived there, him as took\\r\\nwine with me, you remember. Lord, you should hear Selina on the\\r\\nmilitary. Can\\'t say I take to \\'em much myself. I\\'ll bet there\\'ll be\\r\\none or two of them hanging about the place to-night. Phew!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom mopped his forehead again. The carriage had turned in at\\r\\nthe drive, and he glanced towards Brooks a little uneasily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do I look-as though I\\'d been going it a bit?\" he asked. \"Since\\r\\nSelina\\'s got these band-box young men hanging around she\\'s so mighty\\r\\nparticular.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks leaned forward and rescued Mr. Bullsom\\'s tie from underneath his\\r\\near.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re all right,\" he said, reassuringly. \"You mustn\\'t let the girls\\r\\nbully you, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom sat bolt upright.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite right, Brooks,\" he declared. \"I will not. But we took\\r\\non the servants here as well, and they\\'re a bit strange to me. After\\r\\nall, though, I\\'m the boss. I\\'ll let \\'em know it, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA footman threw open the door and took Brooks\\' dressing-case. A butler,\\r\\nhurrying up from the background, ushered them into the drawing-room.\\r\\nMr. Bullsom pulled down his waistcoat and marched in; whistling softly\\r\\na popular tune. Selina and Louise, in elaborate evening gowns, were\\r\\nplaying bridge with two young men.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina rose and held out her hand to Brooks a little languidly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So glad to see you, Mr. Brooks,\" she declared. \"Let me introduce Mr.\\r\\nSuppeton, Captain Meyton!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two young men were good enough to acknowledge the introduction, and\\r\\nBrooks shook hands with Louise. Selina was surveying her father with\\r\\nuplifted eyebrows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, father, where on earth have you been?\" she exclaimed. \"I never\\r\\nsaw anybody such a sight. Your shirt is like a rag, and your collar\\r\\ntoo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never you mind me, Selina,\" Mr. Bullsom answered, firmly. \"As to\\r\\nwhere I\\'ve been, you know quite well. Political dinners may be bad for\\r\\nyour linen, and there may be more healths drunk than is altogether wise,\\r\\nbut a Member of Parliament has to take things as he finds \\'em. Don\\'t\\r\\nlet us interrupt your game. Brooks and I are going to have a game at\\r\\nbilliards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the young men laid down his cards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t we join you?\" he suggested. \"We might have a game of pool, if it\\r\\nisn\\'t too late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are soon tired of bridge,\" Selina remarked, reproachfully. \"Very\\r\\nwell, we will all go into the billiard-room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men played a four-handed game. Between the shots Selina talked to\\r\\nBrooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were you surprised?\" she asked. \"Had you heard?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not a word. I was astonished,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You hadn\\'t seen it in the papers either? Most of them mentioned it--in\\r\\nthe county notes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I so seldom read the newspapers,\" he said. \"You like it, of course?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina was bereft of words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How we ever existed in that hateful suburb,\" she whispered under her\\r\\nbreath. \"And the people round here too are so sociable. Papa being a\\r\\nmember makes a difference, of course. Then the barracks--isn\\'t it\\r\\ndelightful having them so close? There is always something going on. A\\r\\ncricket match to-morrow, I believe. Louise and I are going to play.\\r\\nMrs. Malevey--she\\'s the Colonel\\'s wife, you know persuaded us into it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And your mother?\" Brooks asked a minute or two later.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina tossed her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mother is so foolish,\" she declared. \"She misses the sound of the\\r\\ntrains, and she actually calls the place dead alive, because she can\\'t\\r\\nsit at the windows and see the tradesmen\\'s carts and her neighbours go\\r\\nby. Isn\\'t it ridiculous?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose so,\" he answered. \"Your mother can have her friends out\\r\\nhere, though. It really is only a short drive to Medchester.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She won\\'t have them oftener than I can help,\" Selina declared,\\r\\ndoggedly. \"Old Mrs. Mason called the other day when Captain Meyton and\\r\\nMrs. Malevey were here. It was most awkward. But I don\\'t know why I\\r\\ntell you all these things,\" she declared, abruptly. \"Somehow I always\\r\\nfeel that you are quite an old friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina\\'s languishing glance was intercepted by one of her admirers from\\r\\nthe barracks, as she had intended it to be. Brooks went off to play his\\r\\nshot and returned smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am only too happy that you should feel so,\" he declared. \"Your\\r\\nfather was very kind to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Isn\\'t it almost a pity that you didn\\'t stay in Medchester, Mr.\\r\\nBrooks?\" Selina remarked, with a faint note of patronage in her tone.\\r\\n\"Papa is so much more influential now, you know, and he was always so\\r\\nfond of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is rather a pity,\" Brooks remarked, with twinkling eyes. \"One can\\'t\\r\\nforesee these things, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelina felt it time to bestow her attention elsewhere, and the game soon\\r\\ncame to an end. The girls glanced at the clock and reluctantly\\r\\nwithdrew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember, Miss Bullsom, that we are relying upon you to-morrow,\" the\\r\\nyounger of the two officers remarked, as he opened the door. \"Two\\r\\no\\'clock sharp--but you lunch with Mrs. Malevey first, don\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shan\\'t forget,\" Selina assured him, graciously. \"Good-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two young men left soon afterwards. Mr. Bullsom mixed himself a\\r\\nwhisky-and-soda, and stood for a few minutes on the hearthrug before\\r\\nretiring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re not up to the mark, Brooks, my boy,\" he said, kindly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks shrugged his shoulders. \"I am about as usual,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom set down his glass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, Brooks,\" he said, \"you\\'ve given me many a useful piece of\\r\\nadvice, even when you used to charge me six and eightpence for it. I\\'m\\r\\ngoing to turn the tables. One doesn\\'t need to look at you twice to see\\r\\nthat things aren\\'t going altogether as they should do with you. See\\r\\nhere! Are you sure that you\\'re not cutting off your nose to spite your\\r\\nface, eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps I am,\" Brooks answered. \"But it is too late to draw back now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is never too late,\" Mr. Bullsom declared, vigorously. \"I\\'ve no\\r\\nfancy for weathercocks, but I haven\\'t a ha\\'porth of respect for a man\\r\\nwho ain\\'t smart enough to own up when he\\'s made a mistake, and who isn\\'t\\r\\nwilling to start again on a fresh page. You take my advice, Brooks. Be\\r\\nreconciled with your father, and let \\'em all know who you are. I\\'ve\\r\\nseen a bit of Lord Arranmore, and I\\'ll stake my last shilling that he\\'s\\r\\nnot a bad \\'un at heart. You make it up with him, Brooks. Come, that\\'s\\r\\na straight tip, and it\\'s a good one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks threw away his cigarette and held out his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very good advice, Mr. Bullsom,\" he said, \"under any ordinary\\r\\ncircumstances. I wish I could take it. Good-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bullsom grasped his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re not offended, my boy?\" he asked, anxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I,\" Brooks answered, heartily. \"I\\'m not such an idiot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want to take any liberties,\" Bullsom said, \"and I\\'m afraid I\\r\\nforget sometimes who you are, but that\\'s your fault, seeing that you\\r\\nwill call yourself only Mr. Kingston Brooks when you\\'re by rights a\\r\\nlord. But if you were the Prince of Wales I\\'d still say that my advice\\r\\nwas good. Forgive your father anything you\\'ve got against him, and\\r\\nstart afresh.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'ll think about it,\" Brooks promised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\nA QUESTION AND AN ANSWER\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks returned to London to find the annual exodus already commenced.\\r\\nLady Caroom and Sybil had left for Homburg. Lord Arranmore was yachting\\r\\nin the Channel. Brooks settled down to work, and found it a little\\r\\nwearisome.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe saw nothing of Mary Scott, whose duties now brought her seldom to the\\r\\nhead office. He began to think that she was avoiding him, and there\\r\\ncame upon him about this time a sense of loneliness to which he was\\r\\nsometimes subject. He fought it with hard work--early and late, till\\r\\nthe colour left his cheeks and black lines bordered his eyes. They\\r\\npressed him to take a holiday, but he steadily declined. Mr. Bullsom\\r\\nwrote begging him to spend a week-end at least at Woton Hall. He\\r\\nrefused this and all other invitations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day he took up a newspaper which was chiefly concerned with the\\r\\ndoings of fashionable people, and Lady Caroom\\'s name at once caught his\\r\\neye. He read that her beautiful daughter Lady Sybil was quite the belle\\r\\nof Homburg, that the Duke of Atherstone was in constant attendance, that\\r\\nan interesting announcement might at any moment be made. He threw aside\\r\\nthe paper and looked thoughtfully out into the stuffy little street,\\r\\nwhere even at night the air seemed stifling and unwholesome. After all,\\r\\nwas he making the best of his life? He had started a great work.\\r\\nHundreds and thousands of his fellow creatures would be the better for\\r\\nit. So far all was well enough. But personally--was this entire\\r\\nself-abnegation necessary?--was he fulfilling his duty to himself? was\\r\\nhe not rather sacrificing his future to a prejudice--an idea? In any\\r\\ncase he knew that it was too late to retract. He had renounced his\\r\\nproper position in life, it was too late for him now to claim it. And\\r\\nthere had gone with it--Sybil. After all, why should he arrogate to\\r\\nhimself judgment? The sins of his father were not his concern. It was\\r\\nchiefly he who suffered by his present attitude, yet he had chosen it\\r\\ndeliberately. He could not draw back. He had cut himself off from her\\r\\nworld--he saw now the folly of his ever for a moment having been drawn\\r\\ninto it. It must be a chapter closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weeks passed on, and his loneliness grew. One day the opening of\\r\\nstill another branch brought him for a moment into contact with Mary\\r\\nScott. She too was looking pale, but her manner was bright, even\\r\\nanimated. She seemed to feel none of the dejection which had stolen\\r\\naway from him the whole flavour of life. Her light easy laugh and\\r\\ncheerful conversation were like a tonic to him. He remembered those\\r\\ndays at Medchester After all, she was the first woman whom he had ever\\r\\nlooked upon as a comrade, whom he had ever taken out of her sex and\\r\\nconsidered singly.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke of his ill-looks kindly and with some apprehension.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am all right,\" he assured her, \"but a little dull. Take pity on me\\r\\nand come out to dinner one night this week.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey dined in the annex of a fashionable restaurant practically out of\\r\\ndoors--a cool green lawn for a carpet and a fountain playing close at\\r\\nhand. Mary wore a white dinner-gown, gossamer-like and airy. Her rich\\r\\nbrown hair was tastefully arranged, her voice had never seemed to him so\\r\\nsoft and pleasant. All around was the hum of cheerful conversation. A\\r\\nlittle world of people seemed to be there whose philosophy of life after\\r\\nall was surely the only true one, where hearts were light with the joy\\r\\nof the moment. The dinner was carefully served, the wine, which in his\\r\\nsolitude he had neglected, stole through his veins with a pleasant\\r\\nwarmth. Brooks felt his nerves relax, the light came back to his eyes\\r\\nand the colour to his cheeks. Their conversation grew brighter--almost\\r\\ngay. They both carefully avoided all mention of their work--it was a\\r\\nholiday. The burden of his too carefully thought out life seemed to\\r\\npass away. Brooks felt that his youth was coming to him a little late,\\r\\nbut with delicious freshness.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smoked a cigarette and sipped his coffee, glancing every now and then\\r\\nat his companion with approving eyes. For Mary, whose dress was so\\r\\nseldom a matter of moment to her, chanced to look her best that night.\\r\\nThe delicate pallor of her cheeks under the rich tone of her hair seemed\\r\\nquite apart from any suggestion of ill-health, her eyes were wonderfully\\r\\nfull and soft, a quaint pearl ornament hung by a little gold chain from\\r\\nher slender, graceful neck. A sort of dreamy content came over Brooks.\\r\\nAfter all, why should he throw himself in despair against the gates of\\r\\nthat other world, outside which he himself had elected to dwell? It was\\r\\nonly madness for him to think of Sybil. While Lord Arranmore lived he\\r\\nmust remain Kingston Brooks--and for Kingston Brooks it seemed that even\\r\\nfriendship with her was forbidden. He could live down those memories.\\r\\nThey were far better crushed. He thought of that moment in Mary\\'s\\r\\nsitting-room, that one moment of her self-betrayal, and his heart beat\\r\\nwith an unaccustomed force. Why not rob her of the bitterness of that\\r\\nmemory? He looked at the white hand resting for a moment on the table\\r\\nso close to his, and a sudden impulse came over him to snatch it up, to\\r\\nfeel his loneliness fade away for ever before the new light in her face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us go and sit on the other side of the lawn,\" he said, leaning over\\r\\ntowards her. \"We can hear the music better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey found a quiet seat where the music from the main restaurant reached\\r\\nthem, curiously mingled with the jingling of cab bells from Piccadilly.\\r\\nBrooks leaned over and took her hand. \"Mary,\" he said, \"will you marry\\r\\nme?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him as though expecting to find in his face some vague\\r\\nsign of madness, some clue to words which seemed to her wholly\\r\\nincomprehensible. But he had all the appearance of being in earnest.\\r\\nHis eyes were serious, his fingers had tightened over hers. She drew a\\r\\nlittle away, and every vestige of colour had vanished from her cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marry you?\" she exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bent over her, and he laughed softly in the darkness. A mad impulse\\r\\nwas upon him to kiss her, but he resisted it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not? Does it sound so dreadful?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe drew her fingers away slowly but with determination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had hoped,\" she said, \"that you would have spared me this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Spared you!\" he repeated. \"I do not understand. Spared you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him with flashing eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I suppose I ought to thank you,\" she said, bitterly. \"Only I do\\r\\nnot. I cannot. You were kinder when you joined with me and helped me\\r\\nto ignore--that hateful moment. That was much kinder.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my honour, Mary,\" Brooks declared, earnestly, \"I do not understand\\r\\nyou. I have not the least idea what you mean.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him incredulously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have asked me to marry you,\" she said. \"Why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I care for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Care for me? Does that mean that you--love me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe noted very well that moment\\'s hesitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not true,\" she declared. \"Oh, I know. You ask me out of\\r\\npity--because you cannot forget. I suppose you think it kindness. I\\r\\ndon\\'t! It is hateful!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA light broke in upon him. He tried once more to take her hand, but she\\r\\nwithheld it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only half understand you, Mary,\" he said, earnestly, \"but I can\\r\\nassure you that you are mistaken. As to asking you out of pity--that is\\r\\nridiculous. I want you to be my wife. We care for the same things--we\\r\\ncan help one another--and I seem to have been very lonely lately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you think,\" Mary said, with a curious side-glance at him, \"that I\\r\\nshould cure your loneliness. Thank you. I am very happy as I am.\\r\\nPlease forget everything you have said, and let us go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks was a little bewildered--and manlike a little more in earnest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For some reason or other,\" he said, \"you seem disinclined to take me\\r\\nseriously. I cannot understand you, Mary. At any rate you must answer\\r\\nme differently. I want you to be my wife. I am fond of you--you know\\r\\nthat--and I will do my best to make you happy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" Mary said, hardly. \"I am sorry, but I must decline your\\r\\noffer--absolutely. Now, let us go, shall we?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would have risen, but he laid his hand firmly upon her shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not till I have some sort of explanation,\" he said. \"Is it that you do\\r\\nnot care for me, Mary?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned round upon him with colour enough in her cheeks and a strange\\r\\nangry light burning in her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You might have spared me that also,\" she exclaimed. \"You are\\r\\ndetermined to humiliate me, to make me remember that hateful afternoon\\r\\nin my rooms--oh, I can say it if I like--when I kissed you. I knew then\\r\\nthat sooner or later you would make up your mind that it was your duty\\r\\nto ask me to marry you. Only you might have done it by letter. It\\r\\nwould have been kinder. Never mind. You have purged your conscience,\\r\\nand you have got your answer. Now let us go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks looked at her for a moment amazed beside himself with wonder and\\r\\nself-reproach.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary,\" he said, quietly, \"I give you my word that nothing which I have\\r\\nsaid this evening has the least connection with that afternoon. I give\\r\\nyou my word that not for a moment have I thought of it in connection\\r\\nwith what I have said to you to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him steadfastly, and her eyes were full of things which he\\r\\ncould not understand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When did you make up your mind--to ask me this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pointed to the little table where they had been sitting.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly a few minutes ago. I confess it was an impulse. I think that I\\r\\nrealized as we sat there how dear you had grown to me, Mary--how dull\\r\\nlife was without you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You say these things to me,\" she exclaimed, \"when all the time you love\\r\\nanother woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe started a little. She smiled bitterly as she saw the shadow on his\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean,\" she said, deliberately, \"that you love Sybil Caroom. Is it\\r\\nnot true?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis head drooped a little. He had never asked himself even so much as\\r\\nthis. He was face to face now with all the concentrated emotions which\\r\\nlately had so much disturbed his life. The problem which he had so\\r\\nsedulously avoided was forced upon him ruthlessly, with almost barbaric\\r\\nsimplicity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know,\" he answered, vaguely. \"I have never asked myself. I\\r\\ndo not wish to ask myself. Why do you speak of her? She is not of our\\r\\nworld, the world to which I want to belong. I want to forget her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a little mad to-night, my friend,\" Mary said. \"To-morrow you\\r\\nwill feel differently. If Sybil Caroom cares for you, what does it\\r\\nmatter which world she belongs to? She is not the sort of girl to be\\r\\nbound by old-fashioned prejudices. But I do not understand you at all\\r\\nto-night. You are not yourself. I think that you are--a little cruel.\"\\r\\n\"Cruel?\" he repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer face darkened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, it is only natural,\" she said, with a note of suppressed passion in\\r\\nher how tone. \"It is just the accursed egotism of your sex. What right\\r\\nhave you to make us suffer so--to ask me to marry you--and sit by my\\r\\nside and wonder whether you care for another woman? Can\\'t you see how\\r\\nhumiliating it all is? It is an insult to ask a woman to marry you to\\r\\ncure your loneliness, to make you a home to settle your indecision. It\\r\\nis an insult to ask a woman to marry you for any reason except that you\\r\\ncare for her more than any other woman in the world, and can tell her so\\r\\ntrustfully, eagerly. Please to put me in a cab at once, and never speak\\r\\nof these things again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was half-way across the lawn before he could stop her, her head\\r\\nthrown back, carrying herself proudly and well, moving as it seemed to\\r\\nhim with a sort of effortless dignity wholly in keeping with the vigour\\r\\nof her words. He obeyed her literally. There was nothing else for him\\r\\nto do. His slight effort to join her in the cab she firmly repulsed,\\r\\nholding out her hand and speaking a few cheerful words of thanks for her\\r\\nevening\\'s entertainment. And when the cab rolled away Brooks felt\\r\\nlonelier than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY SYBIL SAYS \"YES\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carriage plunged into the shadow of the pine-woods, and commenced\\r\\nthe long uphill ascent to Saalburg. Lady Caroom put down her parasol\\r\\nand turned towards Sybil, whose eyes were steadfastly fixed upon the\\r\\nnarrow white belt of road ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Sybil,\" she said, \"for our talk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your talk,\" Sybil corrected her, with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m to be listener.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, it may not be so one-sided after all,\" Lady Caroom declared. \"And\\r\\nwe had better make haste, or that impetuous young man of yours will come\\r\\npounding after us on his motor before we know where we are. What are\\r\\nyou going to do about him, Sybil?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you\\'ll have to make up your mind. He\\'s getting on my nerves.\\r\\nYou must decide one way or another.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s quite the nicest young man I know--of his class,\" she remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" Lady Caroom assented. \"And though I think you will admit\\r\\nthat I am one of the least conventional of mothers, I must really say I\\r\\ndon\\'t think that it is exactly a comfortable thing to do to marry a man\\r\\nwho is altogether outside one\\'s own circle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Brooks,\" Sybil said, \"is quite as well bred as Atherstone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is his equal in breeding and in birth,\" Lady Caroom declared. \"You\\r\\nknow all about him. I admit,\" she continued, \"that it sounds like a\\r\\npage out of a novel. But it isn\\'t. The only pity is--from one point of\\r\\nview--that it makes so little difference.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You think,\" Sybil asked, \"that he will really keep his word--that he\\r\\nwill not be reconciled with Lord Arranmore?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure of it, my dear,\" Lady Caroom answered. \"Unless a miracle\\r\\nhappens, he will continue to be Mr. Kingston Brooks for the next ten or\\r\\nfifteen years, for Lord Arranmore\\'s lifetime, and you know that they are\\r\\na long-lived race. So you see the situation remains practically\\r\\nunaltered by what I have told you. Mr. Kingston Brooks is a great\\r\\nfavourite of mine. I am very fond of him indeed. But I very much\\r\\ndoubt--even if he should ask you--whether you would find your position\\r\\nas his wife particularly comfortable. You and I, Sybil, have no secrets\\r\\nfrom one another. I wish you would tell me exactly how you feel about\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil smiled--a little ruefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I knew--exactly,\" she answered, \"I should know exactly what to do.\\r\\nBut I don\\'t. You know how uninteresting our set of young men are as a\\r\\nrule. Well, directly I met Mr. Brooks at Enton I felt that he was\\r\\ndifferent. He interested me very much. Then I have always wanted to do\\r\\nsomething useful, to get something different into my life, and he found\\r\\nme exactly the sort of work I wanted. But he has never talked to me as\\r\\nthough he cared particularly though I think that he does a little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is easy to see,\" Lady Caroom remarked, \"that you are not head over\\r\\nears in love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mother,\" Sybil answered, \"do you believe that girls often do fall head\\r\\nover ears in love? If Mr. Brooks and I met continually, and if he and\\r\\nhis father were reconciled, well, I think it would be quite easy for me\\r\\nvery soon to care for him a great deal. If even now he had followed me\\r\\nhere, was with us often, and showed that he was really very fond of me,\\r\\nI think that I should soon be inclined to return it--perhaps even--I\\r\\ndon\\'t know--to risk marrying him, and giving up our ordinary life. But\\r\\nas it is I like to think of him, I should like him to be here; but I am\\r\\nnot, as you say, head over ears in love with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now about Atherstone?\" Lady Caroom said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Atherstone has improved a great deal,\" Sybil answered,\\r\\nthoughtfully. \"There are a great many things about him which I like\\r\\nvery much. He is always well dressed and fresh and nice. He enjoys\\r\\nhimself without being dissipated, and he is perfectly natural. He is\\r\\nrather boyish perhaps, but then he is young. He is not afraid to laugh,\\r\\nand I like the way he enters into everything. And I think I like his\\r\\npersistence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As his wife,\" Lady Caroom said, \"you would have immense opportunities\\r\\nfor doing good. He has a great deal of property in London, besides\\r\\nthree huge estates in Somerset.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a great consideration,\" Sybil said, earnestly. \"I shall always\\r\\nbe thankful that I met Mr. Brooks. He made me think in a practical way\\r\\nabout things which have always troubled me a little. I should hate to\\r\\nseem thoughtless or ungrateful to him. Will you tell me something,\\r\\nmother?\" Of course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think that he cares--at all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI think he does--a little!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Enough to be reconciled with his father for my sake?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! Not enough for that,\" Lady Caroom answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil drew a little breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think,\" she said, \"that that decides me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long ascent was over at last. They pulled up before the inn, in\\r\\nfront of which the proprietor was already executing a series of low\\r\\nbows. Before they could descend there was a familiar sound from behind,\\r\\nand a young man, in a grey flannel suit and Panama hat, jumped from his\\r\\nmotor and came to the carriage door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be awfully cross!\" he exclaimed, laughing. \"You know you half\\r\\npromised to come with me this afternoon, so I couldn\\'t help having a\\r\\nspin out to see whether I could catch you up. Won\\'t you allow me, Lady\\r\\nCaroom? The step is a little high.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It isn\\'t any use being cross with you,\" Sybil remarked. \"It never\\r\\nseems to make any impression.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am terribly thick-skimmed,\" he answered, \"when I don\\'t want to\\r\\nunderstand. Will you ladies have some tea, or come and see how the\\r\\nrestoration is getting on?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were proposing to go and see what the German Emperor\\'s idea of a\\r\\nRoman camp was,\" Sybil answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you can\\'t shake me off now, can you, Lady Caroom?\" he declared,\\r\\nappealing to her. \"We\\'ll consider it an accident that you found me\\r\\nhere, if you like, but it is in reality a great piece of good fortune\\r\\nfor you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why, may I ask?\" Sybil inquired, with uplifted eyebrows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I\\'m an authority on this place--come here nearly every day to give\\r\\nthe director, as he calls himself, some hints. Come along, Lady Caroom.\\r\\nI\\'ll show you the baths and the old part of the outer wall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom very soon had enough of it. She sat down upon a tree and\\r\\nbrought out her sketchbook.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give me a quarter of an hour, please,\" she begged, \"not longer. I want\\r\\nto be home for tea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey strolled off, Atherstone turning a little nervously to Sybil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say, we\\'ve seen the best part of the ruins,\" he remarked. \"The\\r\\nrenovation\\'s hideous. Let\\'s go in the wood--and I\\'ll show you a\\r\\nsquirrel\\'s nest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil hesitated. Her thoughts for a moment were in confusion. Then she\\r\\nsighed once and turned towards the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never seen a squirrel\\'s nest,\" she said. \"Is it far?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom put her sketch away as she heard their approaching\\r\\nfootsteps, and looked up. Atherstone\\'s happiness was too ridiculously\\r\\napparent. He came straight over to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll give her to me, won\\'t you?\" he exclaimed. \"\\'Pon my word, she\\r\\nshall be the happiest woman in England if I can make her so. I\\'m\\r\\nperfectly certain I\\'m the happiest man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom pressed her daughter\\'s hand, and they all turned to descend\\r\\nthe hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course I\\'m charmed,\" Lady Caroom said. \"Sybil makes me feel so\\r\\nelderly. But I don\\'t know what I shall do for a chaperon now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAtherstone laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m your son-in-law,\" he said. \"I can take you out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSybil shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, you won\\'t,\" she declared. \"The only woman I have ever been really\\r\\njealous of is mother. She has a way of absorbing all the attention from\\r\\nevery one when she is around. I\\'m not going to have her begin with\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I feel,\" Atherstone said, \"like the man who married a twin--said he\\r\\nnever tried to tell the difference, you know, when a pal asked him how\\r\\nhe picked out his own wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you think,\" Sybil said, severely, \"that you have made any\\r\\narrangements of that sort I take it all back. You are going to marry\\r\\nme, if you behave yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Three months is a beastly long time,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom drove back alone. The motor whizzed by her half-way down\\r\\nthe hill--Sybil holding her hat with both hands, her hair blowing about,\\r\\nand her cheeks pink with pleasure. She waved her hand gaily as she went\\r\\nby, and then clutched her hat again. Lady Caroom watched them till they\\r\\nwere out of sight, then she found herself looking steadfastly across the\\r\\nvalley to the dark belt of pine-clad hills beyond. She could see\\r\\nnothing very clearly, and there was a little choking in her throat.\\r\\nThey were both there, father and son. Once she fancied that at last he\\r\\nwas holding out his arms towards her--she sat up in the carriage with a\\r\\nlittle cry which was half a sob. When she drove through the hotel gates\\r\\nit was he who stood upon the steps to welcome her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\nBROOKS HEARS THE NEWS\\r\\n\\r\\nUnchanged! Her first eager glance into his face told her that. Waxen\\r\\nwhite, his lips smiled their courteous greeting upon her, his tone was\\r\\nmeasured and cold as ever. She set her teeth as she rose from her seat,\\r\\nand gathered her skirts in her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You, too, a pilgrim?\" she exclaimed. \"I thought you preferred salt\\r\\nwater.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had a pleasant fortnight\\'s yachting,\" he answered. \"Then I went\\r\\nwith Hennibul to Wiesbaden, and I came on here to see you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you met Sybil and Atherstone?\" she asked him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" he answered, gravely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come into my room,\" she said, \"and I will give you some tea. These\\r\\nyoung people are sure to have it on the terrace. I will join you when I\\r\\nhave got rid of some of this dust.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was alone for ten minutes. At the end of that time she came out\\r\\nthrough the folding-doors with the old smile upon her lips and the old\\r\\nlithesomeness in her movements. He rose and watched her until she had\\r\\nsettled down in her low chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So Sybil is going to marry Atherstone!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. He really deserves it, doesn\\'t he? He is a very nice boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What an everlasting fool Brooks is,\" he said, in a low tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He keeps his word,\" she answered. \"It is a family trait with you,\\r\\nArranmore. You are all stubborn, all self-willed, self-centred,\\r\\nselfish!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t deny it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI won\\'t try. I suppose it is true. Besides, I want to keep you in a\\r\\ngood humour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do tell me why!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If Sybil is going to be married you can\\'t live alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I won\\'t admit that, but what about it? Do you know of a nice\\r\\nrespectable companion?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may be nice,\" she answered, \"but you certainly aren\\'t respectable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am what you make me,\" he answered, in a low tone. \"Catherine! A\\r\\nmoment ago you accused me of stubbornness. What about yourself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, you. You have been the one woman of my life. You are free, you\\r\\nknow that there is no other man who could make you happy as I could, yet\\r\\nyou will not come to me--for the sake of an idea. If I am heartless\\r\\nand callous, an infidel, an egotist, whatever you choose, at least I\\r\\nlove you. You need never fear me. You would always be safe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Arranmore,\" she said, \"this is so painful to me. Do let us cease to\\r\\ndiscuss it. I have tried so hard to make you understand how I feel. I\\r\\ncannot alter. It is impossible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You tempt me,\" he cried, \"to play the hypocrite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I do not, Arranmore,\" she answered, gently, \"for there is no acting\\r\\nin this world which would deceive me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do not doubt that I should make you a good husband?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe you would,\" she answered, \"but I dare not try it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this is the woman,\" he murmured, sadly, \"who calls me stubborn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTea was brought in. Afterwards they walked in the gardens together.\\r\\nThe band was playing, and they were surrounded on all sides by\\r\\nacquaintances. A great personage stopped and talked to them for a\\r\\nwhile. Lady Caroom admitted the news of Sybil\\'s engagement. After that\\r\\nevery one stopped to express pleasure. It was not until the young\\r\\npeople appeared themselves, and at once monopolized all attention, that\\r\\nArranmore was able to draw his companion away into comparative solitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you by any chance correspond with Brooks?\" he asked her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\" she answered. \"I was thinking of that. I should like him to know\\r\\nfrom one of us. Can\\'t you write him, Arranmore?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could,\" he answered, \"but it would perhaps come better from you.\\r\\nHave you ever had any conversation with him about Sybil?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Once,\" she answered, \"yes!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you can write--it will be better for you to write. I should like\\r\\nto ask you a question if I may.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any idea whether the news will be in any way a blow to him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think perhaps it may,\" she admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore was silent. She watched him half eagerly, hoping for some\\r\\nlook, some expression of sympathy. She was disappointed. His face did\\r\\nnot relax. It seemed almost to grow harder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has only himself to blame,\" he said, slowly. \"But for this\\r\\nridiculous masquerading his chance was as good as Atherstone\\'s.\\r\\nQuixoticism such as his is an expensive luxury.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shivered a little.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That sounds hard-hearted,\" she said. \"He is doing what he thinks\\r\\nright.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Lord Arranmore told her what he had told Brooks himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My son is quite a model young man,\" he said, \"but he is a prig. He\\r\\nthinks too much about what is right and wrong, about what is due to\\r\\nhimself, and he values his own judgment too highly. However, I have no\\r\\nright to complain, for it is he who suffers, not I. May I dine at your\\r\\ntable to-night? I came over alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were interrupted a few minutes later by Sybil and Atherstone, and a\\r\\nsmall host of their friends. But in consequence of Lord Arranmore\\'s\\r\\nvisit to Homburg, Brooks a few days later received two letters. The\\r\\nfirst was from Lord Arranmore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"RITTER\\'s HOTEL.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR MR. BROOKS,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The news which I believe Lady Caroom is sending you to-day may perhaps\\r\\nconvince you of the folly of this masquerading. I make you, therefore,\\r\\nthe following offer. I will leave England for at least five years on\\r\\ncondition that you henceforth take up your proper position in society,\\r\\nand consent to such arrangements as Mr. Ascough and I may make. In any\\r\\ncase I was proposing to myself a somewhat extensive scheme of travel,\\r\\nand the opportunity seems to me a good one for you to dispense with an\\r\\nincognito which may lead you some day into even worse complications. I\\r\\ntrust that for the sake of other people with whom you may be brought\\r\\ninto contact you will accept the arrangement which I propose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I remain,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yours faithfully,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"ARRANMORE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other letter was from Lady Caroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"RITTER\\'S HOTEL.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR \\'MR. BROOKS,\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to be the first to tell you of Sybil\\'s engagement to the Duke of\\r\\nAtherstone, which took place this afternoon. He has been a very\\r\\npersistent suitor, and he is a great favourite, I think, deservedly,\\r\\nwith every one. He will, I am sure, make her very happy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understand that you are still in London. You must find this weather\\r\\nvery oppressive. Take my advice and don\\'t overwork yourself. No cause\\r\\nin the world, however good, is worth the sacrifice of one\\'s health.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope that my news will not distress you. You realized, of course,\\r\\nthat your decision to remain known, or rather unknown, as Kingston\\r\\nBrooks, made it at some time or other inevitable, and I hope to see a\\r\\ngood deal of you when we return to town, and that you will always\\r\\nbelieve that I am your most sincere friend,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"CATHERINE CAROOM.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks laid the two letters down with a curious mixture of sensations.\\r\\nHe knew that a very short time ago he might have considered himself\\r\\nbrokenhearted, and he knew that as a matter of fact he was nothing of\\r\\nthe sort. He answered Lady Caroom\\'s letter first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"27, JERMYN STREET, W.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR LADY CAROOM,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was very kind of you to write to me, and to send me the news of\\r\\nSybil\\'s engagement so promptly. I wish her most heartily every\\r\\nhappiness. After all, it is the most suitable thing which could have\\r\\nhappened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are right in your surmise. After our conversation I realized quite\\r\\nplainly that under my present identity I could not possibly think of\\r\\nLady Sybil except as a very charming and a very valued friend. I was,\\r\\ntherefore, quite prepared for the news which you have sent me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am going for a few days\\' golf and sea-bathing into Devonshire, so\\r\\ndon\\'t waste too much sympathy upon me. My best regards to Lady Sybil.\\r\\nJust now I imagine that she is overwhelmed with good wishes, but if she\\r\\nwill add mine to the number, I can assure you and her that I offer them\\r\\nmost heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yours most sincerely,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"KINGSTON BRGOKS.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"P.S.--Have you heard that your friend the Bishop is going to bring a\\r\\nBill before the House of Lords which is to exterminate me altogether?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Caroom sighed for a moment as she read the letter, but immediately\\r\\nafterwards her face cleared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After all, I think it is best,\" she murmured, \"and Atherstone is such a\\r\\ndear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRINCE OF SINNERS SPEAKS OUT\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bishop sat down amidst a little murmur of applause. He glanced up\\r\\nand saw that his wife had heard his speech, and he noted with\\r\\nsatisfaction the long line of reporters, for whose sake he had spoken\\r\\nwith such deliberation and with occasional pauses. He felt that his\\r\\nindictment of this new charitable departure had been scathing and\\r\\nlogical. He was not altogether displeased to see Brooks himself in the\\r\\nStrangers\\' Gallery. That young man would be better able to understand\\r\\nnow the mighty power of the Church which he had so wantonly disregarded.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was not the bishop\\'s speech which had filled Brooks with dismay,\\r\\nwhich had made his heart grow suddenly cold within him. For this he had\\r\\nbeen prepared--but not for the adversary who was now upon his feet\\r\\nprepared to address the House. At least, he said to himself, bitterly,\\r\\nhe might have been spared this. It was Lord Arranmore, who, amidst some\\r\\nmurmurs of surprise, had risen to address the House--pale, composed,\\r\\nsupercilious as ever. And Brooks felt that what he could listen to\\r\\nunmoved from the Bishop of Beeston would be hard indeed to bear from\\r\\nthis man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intervention of Lord Arranmore so early in the debate was wholly\\r\\nunexpected. Every one was interested, and those who knew him best\\r\\nprepared themselves for a little mild sensation. The bishop smiled to\\r\\nhimself with the satisfaction of a man who has secured a welcome but\\r\\nunexpected ally. Lord Arranmore\\'s views as to charity and its\\r\\ndispensation were fairly well known.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo every one listened--at first with curiosity, afterwards with\\r\\nsomething like amazement. The bishop abandoned his expression of gentle\\r\\ntolerance for one of manifest uneasiness. It seemed scarcely credible\\r\\nthat he heard aright. For the Marquis of Arranmore\\'s forefinger was\\r\\nstretched out towards him--a gesture at once relentless and scornful,\\r\\nand the words to which he was forced to listen were not pleasant ones to\\r\\nhear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is such sentiments as these,\" the Marquis of Arranmore was\\r\\nsaying--and his words came like drops of ice, slow and distinct--\"such\\r\\nsentiments as these voiced by such men as the Lord Bishop of Beeston in\\r\\nsuch high places as this where we are now assembled, which have created\\r\\nand nourished our criminal classes, which have filled our prisons and\\r\\nour workhouses, and in time future if his lordship\\'s theology is correct\\r\\nwill people Hell. And as for the logic of it, was ever the intelligence\\r\\nof so learned and august a body of listeners so insulted before? Is\\r\\ncharity, then, for the deserving and the deserving only? Are we to put\\r\\na premium upon hypocrisy, to pass by on the other side from those who\\r\\nhave fallen, and who by themselves have no power to rise? This is\\r\\nprecisely his lordship\\'s proposition. The one great charitable\\r\\ninstitution of our times, founded upon a logical basis, carried out with\\r\\na devotion and a self-sacrifice beyond all praise, he finds pernicious\\r\\nand pauperizing, because, forsooth, the drunkard and criminals are\\r\\nwelcome to avail themselves of it, because it seeks to help those who\\r\\nsave for such help must remain brutes themselves and a brutalizing\\r\\ninfluence to others.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a moment\\'s deep silence. To those who were watching the\\r\\nspeaker closely, and amongst them Brooks, was evident some sign of\\r\\ninternal agitation. Yet when he spoke again his manner was, if\\r\\npossible, more self-restrained than ever. He continued in a low clear\\r\\ntone, without any further gesture and emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My lords, I heard a remark not intended for my ears, upon my rising,\\r\\nindicative of surprise that I should have anything to say upon such a\\r\\nsubject as this. Lest my convictions and opinions should seem to you\\r\\nto be those of an outsider, let me tell you this. You are listening to\\r\\none who for twelve years lived the life of this unhappy people, dwelt\\r\\namongst them as a police-court missionary--one who was driven even into\\r\\nsome measure of insanity by the horrors he saw and tasted, and who\\r\\nrecovered only by an ignominious flight into a far-off country. His\\r\\nlordship the Bishop of Beeston has shown you very clearly how little he\\r\\nknows of the horrors which seethe beneath the brilliant life of this\\r\\nwonderful city. He has brought it upon himself and you--that one who\\r\\ndoes know shall tell you something of the truth of these things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an intense and breathless silence. This was an assembly\\r\\namongst whom excitement was a very rare visitant. But there were many\\r\\nthere now who sat still and spellbound with eyes riveted upon the\\r\\nspeaker. To those who were personally acquainted with him a certain\\r\\nchange in his appearance was manifest. A spot of colour flared in his\\r\\npale cheeks. There was a light in his eyes which no one had ever seen\\r\\nthere before. After years of self-repression, of a cynicism partly\\r\\nartificial, partly inevitable, the natural man had broken out once more,\\r\\nstung into life by time smooth platitudes of the great churchman\\r\\nagainst whom his attack was directed. He was reckless of time fact\\r\\nthat Lady Caroom, Brooks, and many of his acquaintances were in the\\r\\nStrangers\\' Gallery. For the motion before the House was one to obtain\\r\\nlegal and ecclesiastical control over all independent charities\\r\\nappealing to the general public for support, under cover of which the\\r\\nChurch, in the person of the Bishop of Beeston, had made a solemn and\\r\\ndeliberate attack upon Brooks\\' Society, Brooks himself, its aims and\\r\\nmanagement.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the words fell, deliberately, yet without hesitation, from his lips,\\r\\nvivid, scathing, forceful, there was not one there but knew that this\\r\\nman spoke of the things which he had felt. The facts he marshalled\\r\\nbefore them were appalling, but not a soul doubted them. It was truth\\r\\nwhich he hurled at them, truth before which the Bishop sat back in his\\r\\nseat and felt his cheeks grow paler and his eyes more full of trouble.\\r\\nA great deal of it they had heard before, but never like this--never had\\r\\nit been driven home into their conscience so that doubt or evasion was\\r\\nimpossible. And this man, who was he? They rubbed their eyes and\\r\\nwondered. Ninth Marquis of Arranmore, owner of great estates,\\r\\ndilettante, sportsman, cynic, latter-day sinner--or an apostle touched\\r\\nwith fire from Heaven to open men\\'s eyes, gifted for a few brief minutes\\r\\nwith the tongue of a saintly Demosthenes. Those who knew him gaped like\\r\\nchildren and wondered. And all the time his words stung them like drops\\r\\nof burning rain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This,\" he concluded at last, \"is the Hell which burns for ever under\\r\\nthis great city, and it is such men as his lordship the Bishop of\\r\\nBeeston who can come here and speak of their agony in well-rounded\\r\\nperiods and congratulate you and himself upon the increasing number of\\r\\ncommunicants in the East End--who stands in the market-place of the\\r\\nworld with stones for starving people. But I, who have been down\\r\\namongst those fires, I, who know, can tell you this: Not all the\\r\\nchurches of Christ, not all the religious societies ever founded, not\\r\\nall the combined labours of all the missionaries who ever breathed,\\r\\nwill quench or even abate those flames until they go to their labours in\\r\\nthe name of humanity alone, and free themselves utterly from all the\\r\\ncursed restrictions and stipulations of their pet creed. Starving men\\r\\nwill mock at the mention of a God of Justice, men who are in torture\\r\\nbody and soul are scarcely likely to respond to the teachings of a God\\r\\nof Love. Save the bodies of this generation, and the souls of the next\\r\\nmay be within your reach.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey thought then that he had finished. He paused for an unusually long\\r\\ntime. When he spoke again he seemed to have wholly regained his usual\\r\\ncomposure. The note of passion had passed from his tone. His cheeks\\r\\nwere once more of waxen pallor. The deliberately-chosen words fell with\\r\\na chill sarcasm from his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His lordship the Bishop of Beeston,\" he said, \"has also thought fit, on\\r\\nthe authority, I presume, of Mr. Lavilette and his friends, to make\\r\\nslighting reference to the accounts of the Society in question. As one\\r\\nof the largest subscribers to that Society, may I be allowed to set at\\r\\nrest his anxieties? Before many days the accounts from its very\\r\\nearliest days, which have all the time been in the hands of an eminent\\r\\nfirm of accountants, will be placed before the general public. In the\\r\\nmeantime let me tell you this. I am willing to sign every page of\\r\\nthem. I pledge my word to their absolute correctness. The author of\\r\\nthis movement has from the first, according to my certain knowledge,\\r\\ndevoted a considerable part of his own income to the work. If others\\r\\nwho are in the enjoyment of a princely stipend for their religious\\r\\nlabours\"--he looked hard at the bishop--\"were to imitate this course of\\r\\naction, I imagine that there are a good many charitable institutions\\r\\nwhich would not now be begging for donations to keep them alive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat down without peroration, and almost immediately afterwards left\\r\\nthe House. The first reading of the bishop\\'s Bill was lost by a large\\r\\nmajority.\\r\\n\\r\\nArranmore sat by himself in his study, and his face was white and drawn.\\r\\nA cigarette which he had lit on entering the room had burnt out between\\r\\nhis fingers. This sudden upheaval of the past, coming upon him with a\\r\\ncertain spasmodic unexpectedness, had shaken his nerves. He had not\\r\\nbelieved himself capable of anything of the sort. The unusual\\r\\nexcitement was upon him still. All sorts of memories and fancies long\\r\\nago buried, thronged in upon him. So he sat there and suffered,\\r\\nstriving in vain to crush them, whilst faces mocked him from the\\r\\nshadows, and familiar voices rang strangely in his ears. He scarcely\\r\\nheard the softly-opened door. The light footsteps and the rustling of\\r\\nskirts had their place amongst the throng of torturing memories. But\\r\\nhis eyes--surely his eyes could not mock him. He started to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Catherine!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not speak at once, but all sorts of things were in her eyes. He\\r\\nground his teeth together, and made one effort to remain his old self.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have come to offer--your sympathy. How delightful of you. The\\r\\nbishop got on my nerves, you know, and I really am not answerable for\\r\\nwhat I said. Catherine!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe threw her arms around his neck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You dear!\" she exclaimed. \"I am not afraid of you any more. Kiss me,\\r\\nPhilip, and don\\'t talk nonsense, because I shan\\'t listen to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooks drove up in hot haste. The butler stopped him respectfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His lordship is particularly engaged, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He will see me,\" Brooks answered. \"Please announce me--Lord Kingston\\r\\nof Ross!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" the man stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Kingston of Ross,\" Brooks repeated, casting off for ever the old\\r\\nname as though it were a disused glove. \"Announce me at once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the Arranmore trick of imperiousness, and the man recognized it.\\r\\nHe threw open the study door with trembling fingers, but he was careful\\r\\nto knock first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord Kingston of Ross.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked to his father with outstretched hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You were right, sir,\" he said, simply. \"I was a prig!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stood for a moment, their hands locked. It was a silent greeting,\\r\\nbut their faces were eloquent. Brooks looked from his father to Lady\\r\\nCaroom and smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I could not wait,\" he said. \"I was forced to come to you at once.\\r\\nBut I think that I will go now and pay another call.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood outside on the kerb while they fetched him a hansom. The fresh\\r\\nnight wind blew in his face, cool and sweet. From Piccadilly came the\\r\\nfaint hum of tram, and the ceaseless monotonous beat of hurrying\\r\\nfootsteps. The hansom pulled up before him with a jerk. He sprang\\r\\nlightly in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. 110, Crescent Flats, Kensington.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'),\n",

              "  '\\r\\nNIGHT WATCHES\\r\\n\\r\\nBy W.W. Jacobs\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEAKER VESSEL\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gribble sat in his small front parlour in a state of angry\\r\\namazement. It was half-past six and there was no Mrs. Gribble; worse\\r\\nstill, there was no tea.  It was a state of things that had only\\r\\nhappened once before. That was three weeks after marriage, and on that\\r\\noccasion Mr. Gribble had put his foot down with a bang that had echoed\\r\\ndown the corridors of thirty years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fire in the little kitchen was out, and the untidy remains of Mrs.\\r\\nGribble\\'s midday meal still disgraced the table.  More and more dazed,\\r\\nthe indignant husband could only come to the conclusion that she had\\r\\ngone out and been run over.  Other things might possibly account for her\\r\\nbehaviour; that was the only one that would excuse it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis meditations were interrupted by the sound of a key in the front\\r\\ndoor, and a second later a small, anxious figure entered the room and,\\r\\nleaning against the table, strove to get its breath.  The process was\\r\\nnot helped by the alarming distension of Mr. Gribble\\'s figure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--I got home--quick as I could--Henry,\" said Mrs. Gribble, panting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is my tea?\"  demanded her husband.  \"What do you mean by it?  The\\r\\nfire\\'s out and the kitchen is just as you left it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--I\\'ve been to a lawyer\\'s, Henry,\" said Mrs. Gribble, \"and I had to\\r\\nwait.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lawyer\\'s?\"  repeated her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I got a letter this afternoon telling me to call.  Poor Uncle George,\\r\\nthat went to America, is gone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is no excuse for neglecting me,\" said Mr. Gribble.  \"Of course\\r\\npeople die when they are old.  Is that the one that got on and made\\r\\nmoney?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife, apparently struggling to repress a little excitement, nodded.\\r\\n\"He--he\\'s left me two hundred pounds a year for life, Henry,\" she said,\\r\\ndabbing at her pale blue eyes with a handkerchief.  \"They\\'re going to\\r\\npay it monthly; sixteen pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence a month.\\r\\nThat\\'s how he left it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two hund--\" began Mr. Gribble, forgetting himself.  \"Two hun----Go and\\r\\nget my tea!  If you think you\\'re going to give yourself airs because\\r\\nyour uncle\\'s left you money, you won\\'t do it in my house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took a chair by the window, and, while his wife busied herself in the\\r\\nkitchen, sat gazing in blank delight at the little street.  Two hundred\\r\\na year!  It was all he could do to resume his wonted expression as his\\r\\nwife re-entered the room and began to lay the table.  His manner,\\r\\nhowever, when she let a cup and saucer slip from her trembling fingers\\r\\nto smash on the floor left nothing to be desired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s nice to have money come to us in our old age,\" said Mrs. Gribble,\\r\\ntimidly, as they sat at tea.  \"It takes a load off my mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Old age!\" said her husband, disagreeably.  \"What d\\'ye mean by old age?\\r\\nI\\'m fifty-two, and feel as young as ever I did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You look as young as ever you did,\" said the docile Mrs. Gribble. \"I\\r\\ncan\\'t see no change in you.  At least, not to speak of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not so much talk,\" said her husband.  \"When I want your opinion of my\\r\\nlooks I\\'ll ask you for it.  When do you start getting this money?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tuesday week; first of May,\" replied his wife.  \"The lawyers are going\\r\\nto send it by registered letter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gribble grunted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall be sorry to leave the house for some things,\" said his wife,\\r\\nlooking round.  \"We\\'ve been here a good many years now, Henry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leave the house!\"  repeated Mr. Gribble, putting down his tea-cup and\\r\\nstaring at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leave the house!  What are you talking about?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we can\\'t stay here, Henry,\" faltered Mrs. Gribble.  \"Not with all\\r\\nthat money.  They are building some beautiful houses in Charlton Grove\\r\\nnow--bathroom, tiled hearths, and beautiful stained glass in the front\\r\\ndoor; and all for twenty-eight pounds a year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wonderful!\"  said the other, with a mocking glint in his eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And iron palings to the front garden, painted chocolate-colour picked\\r\\nout with blue,\" continued his wife, eyeing him wistfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gribble struck the table a blow with his fist.  \"This house is good\\r\\nenough for me,\" he roared; \"and what\\'s good enough for me is good enough\\r\\nfor you.  You want to waste money on show; that\\'s what you want.\\r\\nStained glass and bow-windows!  You want a bow-window to loll about in,\\r\\ndo you? Shouldn\\'t wonder if you don\\'t want a servant-gal to do the\\r\\nwork.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gribble flushed guiltily, and caught her breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'re going to live as we\\'ve always lived,\" pursued Mr. Gribble.\\r\\n\"Money ain\\'t going to spoil me.  I ain\\'t going to put on no side just\\r\\nbecause I\\'ve come in for a little bit.  If you had your way we should\\r\\nend up in the workhouse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe filled his pipe and smoked thoughtfully, while Mrs. Gribble cleared\\r\\naway the tea-things and washed up.  Pictures, good to look upon, formed\\r\\nin the smoke-pictures of a hale, hearty man walking along the primrose\\r\\npath arm-in-arm with two hundred a year; of the mahogany and plush of\\r\\nthe saloon bar at the Grafton Arms; of Sunday jaunts, and the Oval on\\r\\nsummer afternoons.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ate his breakfast slowly on the first of the month, and, the meal\\r\\nfinished, took a seat in the window with his pipe and waited for the\\r\\npostman.  Mrs. Gribble\\'s timid reminders concerning the flight of time\\r\\nand consequent fines for lateness at work fell on deaf ears.  He jumped\\r\\nup suddenly and met the postman at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has it come?\"  inquired Mrs. Gribble, extending her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy way of reply her husband tore open the envelope and, handing her the\\r\\ncovering letter, counted the notes and coin and placed them slowly in\\r\\nhis pockets.  Then, as Mrs. Gribble looked at him, he looked at the\\r\\nclock, and, snatching up his hat, set off down the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was late home that evening, and his manner forbade conversation.\\r\\nMrs. Gribble, with the bereaved air of one who has sustained an\\r\\nirremediable loss, sighed fitfully, and once applied her handkerchief to\\r\\nher eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s no good,\" said her husband at last; \"that won\\'t bring him back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bring who back?\" inquired Mrs. Gribble, in genuine surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, your Uncle George,\" said Mr. Gribble.  \"That\\'s what you\\'re turning\\r\\non the water-cart for, ain\\'t it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wasn\\'t thinking of him,\" said Mrs. Gribble, trying to speak bravely.\\r\\n\"I was thinking of----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you ought to be,\" interrupted her husband.  \"He wasn\\'t my uncle,\\r\\npoor chap, but I\\'ve been thinking of him, off and on, all day.  That\\r\\nbloater-paste you are eating now came from his kindness.  I brought it\\r\\nhome as a treat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was thinking of my clothes,\" said Mrs. Gribble, clenching her hands\\r\\ntogether under the table.  \"When I found I had come in for that money,\\r\\nthe first thing I thought was that I should be able to have a decent\\r\\ndress.  My old ones are quite worn out, and as for my hat and jacket--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go on,\" said her husband, fiercely.  \"Go on.  That\\'s just what I said:\\r\\ntrust you with money, and we should be poorer than ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m ashamed to be seen out,\" said Mrs. Gribble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A woman\\'s place is the home,\" said Mr. Gribble; \"and so long as I\\'m\\r\\nsatisfied with your appearance nobody else matters.  So long as I am\\r\\npleased, that\\'s everything.  What do you want to go dressing yourself up\\r\\nfor?  Nothing looks worse than an over-dressed woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are we going to do with all that money, then?\"  inquired Mrs.\\r\\nGribble, in trembling tones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'ll do,\" said Mr. Gribble, decidedly.  \"That\\'ll do.  One o\\' these\\r\\ndays you\\'ll go too far.  You start throwing that money in my teeth and\\r\\nsee what happens.  I\\'ve done my best for you all these years, and\\r\\nthere\\'s no reason to suppose I sha\\'n\\'t go on doing so.  What did you\\r\\nsay?  What!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gribble turned to him a face rendered ghastly by terror.  \"I--I\\r\\nsaid--it was my money,\" she stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gribble rose, and stood for a full minute regarding her.  Then,\\r\\nkicking a chair out of his way, he took his hat from its peg in the\\r\\npassage and, with a bang of the street-door that sent a current of\\r\\nfresh, sweet air circulating through the house, strode off to the\\r\\nGrafton Arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was past eleven when he returned, but even the spectacle of his wife\\r\\nlaboriously darning her old dress failed to reduce his good-humour in\\r\\nthe slightest degree.  In a frivolous mood he even took a feather from\\r\\nthe dismembered hat on the table and stuck it in his hair.  He took the\\r\\nstump of a strong cigar from his lips and, exhaling a final cloud of\\r\\nsmoke, tossed it into the fireplace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Uncle George dead,\" he said, at last, shaking his head.  \"Hadn\\'t\\r\\npleasure acquaintance, but good man.  Good man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head again and gazed mistily at his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was a teetotaller,\" she remarked, casually.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was tee-toiler,\" repeated Mr. Gribble, regarding her equably.  \"Good\\r\\nman.  Uncle George dead-tee-toller.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gribble gathered up her work and began to put it away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bed-time,\" said Mr. Gribble, and led the way upstairs, singing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis good-humour had evaporated by the morning, and, having made a light\\r\\nbreakfast of five cups of tea, he went off, with lagging steps, to work.\\r\\nIt was a beautiful spring morning, and the idea of a man with two\\r\\nhundred a year and a headache going off to a warehouse instead of a\\r\\nday\\'s outing seemed to border upon the absurd.  What use was money\\r\\nwithout freedom? His toil was sweetened that day by the knowledge that\\r\\nhe could drop it any time he liked and walk out, a free man, into the\\r\\nsunlight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of a week his mind was made up.  Each day that passed made\\r\\nhis hurried uprising and scrambled breakfast more and more irksome; and\\r\\non Monday morning, with hands in trouser-pockets and legs stretched out,\\r\\nhe leaned back in his chair and received his wife\\'s alarming intimations\\r\\nas to the flight of time with a superior and sphinx-like smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s too fine to go to work to-day,\" he said, lazily.  \"Come to that,\\r\\nany day is too fine to waste at work.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gribble sat gasping at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So on Saturday I gave \\'em a week\\'s notice,\" continued her husband, \"and\\r\\nafter Potts and Co. had listened while I told \\'em what I thought of \\'em,\\r\\nthey said they\\'d do without the week\\'s notice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ve never given up your job?\"  said Mrs. Gribble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I spoke to old Potts as one gentleman of independent means to another,\"\\r\\nsaid Mr. Gribble, smiling.  \"Thirty-five bob a week after twenty years\\'\\r\\nservice!  And he had the cheek to tell me I wasn\\'t worth that.  When I\\r\\ntold him what he was worth he talked about sending for the police.  What\\r\\nare you looking like that for?  I\\'ve worked hard for you for thirty\\r\\nyears, and I\\'ve had enough of it.  Now it\\'s your turn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'d find it hard to get another place at your age,\" said his wife;\\r\\n\"especially if they wouldn\\'t give you a good character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Place!\"  said the other, staring.  \"Place!  I tell you I\\'ve done with\\r\\nwork.  For a man o\\' my means to go on working for thirty-five bob a week\\r\\nis ridiculous.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But suppose anything happened to me,\" said his wife, in a troubled\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s not very likely,\" said Mr. Gribble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re tough enough.  And if it did your money would come to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gribble shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"WHAT?\" roared her husband, jumping up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve only got it for life, Henry, as I told you,\" said Mrs. Gribble, in\\r\\nalarm.  \"I thought you knew it would stop when I died.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what\\'s to become of me if anything happens to you, then?\"  demanded\\r\\nthe dismayed Mr. Gribble.  \"What am I to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gribble put her handkerchief to her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And don\\'t start weakening your constitution by crying,\" shouted the\\r\\nincensed husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you mumbling?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I sa--sa--said, let\\'s hope--you\\'ll go first,\" sobbed his wife.  \"Then\\r\\nit will be all right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gribble opened his mouth, and then, realizing the inadequacy of the\\r\\nEnglish language for moments of stress, closed it again.  He broke his\\r\\nsilence at last in favour of Uncle George.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mind you,\" he said, concluding a peroration which his wife listened to\\r\\nwith her fingers in her ears--\"mind you, I reckon I\\'ve been absolutely\\r\\ndone by you and your precious Uncle George.  I\\'ve given up a good\\r\\nsituation, and now, any time you fancy to go off the hooks, I\\'m to be\\r\\nturned into the street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll try and live, for your sake, Henry,\" said his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Think of my worry every time you are ill,\" pursued the indignant Mr.\\r\\nGribble.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gribble sighed, and her husband, after a few further remarks\\r\\nconcerning Uncle George, his past and his future, announced his\\r\\nintention of going to the lawyers and seeing whether anything could be\\r\\ndone.  He came back in a state of voiceless gloom, and spent the rest of\\r\\na beautiful day indoors, smoking a pipe which had lost much of its\\r\\nflavour, and regarding with a critical and anxious eye the small, weedy\\r\\nfigure of his wife as she went about her work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second month\\'s payment went into his pocket as a matter of course,\\r\\nbut on this occasion Mrs. Gribble made no requests for new clothes or\\r\\nchange of residence.  A little nervous cough was her sole comment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Got a cold?\"  inquired her husband, starting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think so,\" replied his wife, and, surprised and touched at this\\r\\nunusual display of interest, coughed again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it your throat or your chest?\"  he inquired, gruffly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gribble coughed again to see.  After five coughs she said she\\r\\nthought it was her chest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'d better not go out o\\' doors to-day, then,\" said Mr. Gribble.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t stand about in draughts; and I\\'ll fetch you in a bottle of cough\\r\\nmixture when I go out.  What about a lay-down on the sofa?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife thanked him, and, reaching the sofa, watched with half-closed\\r\\neyes as he cleared the breakfast-table.  It was the first time he had\\r\\ndone such a thing in his life, and a little honest pride in the\\r\\npossession of such a cough would not be denied.  Dim possibilities of\\r\\nits vast usefulness suddenly occurred to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took the cough mixture for a week, by which time other symptoms,\\r\\nextremely disquieting to an ease-loving man, had manifested themselves.\\r\\nGoing upstairs deprived her of breath; carrying a loaded tea-tray\\r\\nproduced a long and alarming stitch in the side.  The last time she ever\\r\\nfilled the coal-scuttle she was discovered sitting beside it on the\\r\\nfloor in a state of collapse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'d better go and see the doctor,\" said Mr. Gribble.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gribble went.  Years before the doctor had told her that she ought\\r\\nto take life easier, and she was now able to tell him she was prepared\\r\\nto take his advice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And, you see, I must take care of myself now for the sake of my\\r\\nhusband,\" she said, after she had explained matters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understand,\" said the doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If anything happened to me--\" began the patient.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing shall happen,\" said the other.  \"Stay in bed to-morrow morning,\\r\\nand I\\'ll come round and overhaul you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gribble hesitated.  \"You might examine me and think I was all\\r\\nright,\" she objected; \"and at the same time you wouldn\\'t know how I\\r\\nfeel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know just how you feel,\" was the reply.  \"Good-bye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came round the following morning and, following the dejected Mr.\\r\\nGribble upstairs, made a long and thorough investigation of his patient.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say \\'ninety-nine,\\'\" he said, adjusting his stethoscope.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gribble ticked off \"ninety-nines\" until her husband\\'s ears ached\\r\\nwith them.  The doctor finished at last, and, fastening his bag, stood\\r\\nwith his beard in his hand, pondering.  He looked from the little,\\r\\nwhitefaced woman on the bed to the bulky figure of Mr. Gribble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You had better lie up for a week,\" he said, decidedly.  \"The rest will\\r\\ndo you good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing serious, I s\\'pose?\"  said Mr. Gribble, as he led the way\\r\\ndownstairs to the small parlour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She ought to be all right with care,\" was the reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Care?\"  repeated the other, distastefully.  \"What\\'s the matter with\\r\\nher?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She\\'s not very strong,\" said the doctor; \"and hearts don\\'t improve with\\r\\nage, you know.  Under favourable conditions she\\'s good for some years\\r\\nyet.  The great thing is never to thwart her.  Let her have her own way\\r\\nin everything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Own way in everything?\"  repeated the dumbfounded Mr. Gribble.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor nodded.  \"Never let her worry about anything,\" he continued;\\r\\n\"and, above all, never find fault with her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not,\" said Mr. Gribble, thickly--\"not even for her own good?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unless you want to run the risk of losing her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gribble shivered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let her have an easy time,\" said the doctor, taking up his hat.\\r\\n\"Pamper her a bit if you like; it won\\'t hurt her.  Above all, don\\'t let\\r\\nthat heart of hers get excited.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook hands with the petrified Mr. Gribble and went off, grinning\\r\\nwickedly.  He had few favourites, and Mr. Gribble was not one of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two days the devoted husband did the housework and waited on the\\r\\ninvalid.  Then he wearied, and, at his wife\\'s suggestion, a small girl\\r\\nwas engaged as servant.  She did most of the nursing as well, and,\\r\\nhaving a great love for the sensational, took a grave view of her\\r\\nmistress\\'s condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a relief to Mr. Gribble when his wife came downstairs again, and\\r\\nhe was cheered to see that she looked much better.  His satisfaction was\\r\\nso marked that it brought on her cough again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s this house, I think,\" she said, with a resigned smile.  \"It never\\r\\ndid agree with me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you\\'ve lived in it a good many years,\" said her husband,\\r\\ncontrolling himself with difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s rather dark and small,\" said Mrs. Gribble.  \"Not but what it is\\r\\ngood enough for me.  And I dare say it will last my time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense!\"  said her husband, gruffly.  \"You want to get out a bit\\r\\nmore. You\\'ve got nothing to do now we are wasting all this money on a\\r\\nservant. Why don\\'t you go out for little walks?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gribble went, after several promptings, and the fruit of one of\\r\\nthem was handed by the postman to Mr. Gribble a few days afterwards.\\r\\nHalf-choking with wrath and astonishment, he stood over his trembling\\r\\nwife with the first draper\\'s bill he had ever received.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One pound two shillings and threepence three-farthings!\" he recited.\\r\\n\"It must be a mistake.  It must be for somebody else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gribble, with her hand to her heart, tottered to the sofa and lay\\r\\nthere with her eyes closed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had to get some dress material,\" she said, in a quavering voice.\\r\\n\"You want me to go out, and I\\'m so shabby I\\'m ashamed to be seen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gribble made muffled noises in his throat; then, afraid to trust\\r\\nhimself, he went into the back-yard and, taking a seat on an upturned\\r\\nbucket, sat with his head in his hands peering into the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dressmaker\\'s bill and a bill for a new hat came after the next\\r\\nmonthly payment; and a bill for shoes came a week later.  Hoping much\\r\\nfrom the well-known curative effects of fine feathers, he managed to\\r\\ntreat the affair with dignified silence.  The only time he allowed full\\r\\nplay to his feelings Mrs. Gribble took to her bed for two days, and the\\r\\ndoctor had a heart-to-heart talk with him on the doorstep.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a matter of great annoyance to him that his wife still continued\\r\\nto attribute her ill-health to the smallness and darkness of the house;\\r\\nand the fact that there were only two of the houses in Charlton Grove\\r\\nleft caused a marked depression of spirits.  It was clear that she was\\r\\nfretting.  The small servant went further, and said that she was fading\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey moved at the September quarter, and a slight, but temporary,\\r\\nimprovement in Mrs. Gribble\\'s health took place.  Her cheeks flushed and\\r\\nher eyes sparkled over new curtains and new linoleum.  The tiled\\r\\nhearths, and stained glass in the front door filled her with a deep and\\r\\nsolemn thankfulness.  The only thing that disturbed her was the fact\\r\\nthat Mr. Gribble, to avoid wasting money over necessaries, contrived to\\r\\nspend an unduly large portion on personal luxuries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We ought to have some new things for the kitchen,\" she said one day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No money,\" said Mr. Gribble, laconically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And a mat for the bathroom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gribble got up and went out.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had to go to him for everything.  Two hundred a year and not a penny\\r\\nshe could call her own!  She consulted her heart, and that faithful\\r\\norgan responded with a bound that set her nerves quivering.  If she\\r\\ncould only screw her courage to the sticking-point the question would be\\r\\nsettled for once and all.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite and trembling she sat at breakfast on the first of November,\\r\\nwaiting for the postman, while the unconscious Mr. Gribble went on with\\r\\nhis meal.  The double-knocks down the road came nearer and nearer, and\\r\\nMr. Gribble, wiping his mouth, sat upright with an air of alert and\\r\\npleased interest.  Rapid steps came to the front door, and a double bang\\r\\nfollowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Always punctual,\" said Mr. Gribble, good-humouredly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife made no reply, but, taking a blue-crossed envelope from the\\r\\nmaid in her shaking fingers, looked round for a knife.  Her gaze\\r\\nencountered Mr. Gribble\\'s outstretched hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After you,\" he said sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gribble found the knife, and, hacking tremulously at the envelope,\\r\\npeeped inside it and, with her gaze fastened on the window, fumbled for\\r\\nher pocket.  She was so pale and shook so much that the words died away\\r\\non her husband\\'s lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You--you had better let me take care of that,\" he said, at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is--all right,\" gasped his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe put her hand to her throat and, hardly able to believe in her\\r\\nvictory, sat struggling for breath.  Before her, grim and upright, her\\r\\nhusband sat, a figure of helpless smouldering wrath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You might lose it,\" he said, at last.  \"I sha\\'n\\'t lose it,\" said his\\r\\nwife.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo avoid further argument, she arose and went slowly upstairs.  Through\\r\\nthe doorway Mr. Gribble saw her helping herself up by the banisters, her\\r\\nleft hand still at her throat.  Then he heard her moving slowly about in\\r\\nthe bedroom overhead.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took out his pipe and filled it mechanically, and was just holding a\\r\\nmatch to the tobacco when he paused and gazed with a puzzled air at the\\r\\nceiling.  \"Blamed if it don\\'t sound like somebody dancing!\"  he growled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'),\n",

I will answer more fully\\r\\nsoon. Will say now that all your despatches to the Secretary of War have\\r\\nbeen promptly shown to me. Have done and shall do all I could and can to\\r\\nsustain you. Hoped that the opening of James River and putting Wool and\\r\\nBurnside in communication, with an open road to Richmond, or to you, had\\r\\neffected something in that direction. I am still unwilling to take all our\\r\\nforce off the direct line between Richmond and here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSPEECH TO THE 12TH INDIANA REGIMENT, MAY [15?] 1862\\r\\n\\r\\nSOLDIERS, OF THE TWELFTH INDIANA REGIMENT:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has not been customary heretofore, nor will it be hereafter, for me\\r\\nto say something to every regiment passing in review. It occurs too\\r\\nfrequently for me to have speeches ready on all occasions. As you have\\r\\npaid such a mark of respect to the chief magistrate, it appears that I\\r\\nshould say a word or two in reply. Your colonel has thought fit, on his\\r\\nown account and in your name, to say that you are satisfied with the\\r\\nmanner in which I have performed my part in the difficulties which have\\r\\nsurrounded the nation. For your kind expressions I am extremely grateful,\\r\\nbut on the other hand I assure you that the nation is more indebted to\\r\\nyou, and such as you, than to me. It is upon the brave hearts and strong\\r\\narms of the people of the country that our reliance has been placed in\\r\\nsupport of free government and free institutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the part which you and the brave army of which you are a part have,\\r\\nunder Providence, performed in this great struggle, I tender more thanks\\r\\nespecially to this regiment, which has been the subject of good report.\\r\\nThe thanks of the nation will follow you, and may God\\'s blessing rest upon\\r\\nyou now and forever. I hope that upon your return to your homes you will\\r\\nfind your friends and loved ones well and happy. I bid you farewell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, May 16, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the strength of your force now actually with you?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMEMORANDUM OF PROPOSED ADDITIONS TO INSTRUCTIONS OF ABOVE DATE\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL McDOWELL, AND GENERAL MEIGS\\'S INDORSEMENT THEREON.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 17, 1862. You will retain the separate command of the forces taken\\r\\nwith you; but while co-operating with General McClellan you will obey his\\r\\norders, except that you are to judge, and are not to allow your force to\\r\\nbe disposed otherwise than so as to give the greatest protection to this\\r\\ncapital which may be possible from that distance.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Indorsement.]\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President having shown this to me, I suggested that it is dangerous to\\r\\ndirect a subordinate not to obey the orders of his superior in any case,\\r\\nand that to give instructions to General McClellan to this same end and\\r\\nfurnish General McDowell with a copy thereof would effect the object\\r\\ndesired by the President. He desired me to say that the sketch of\\r\\ninstructions to General McClellan herewith he thought made this addition\\r\\nunnecessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nRespectfully, M. C. M.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMILITARY EMANCIPATION\\r\\n\\r\\nINDORSEMENT RELATING TO GENERAL DAVID HUNTER\\'S ORDER OF MILITARY\\r\\nEMANCIPATION,\\r\\n\\r\\nMAY 17, 1862\\r\\n\\r\\nNo commanding general shall do such a thing upon my responsibility without\\r\\nconsulting me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, May 18, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL: Your despatch to the President, asking reinforcements, has been\\r\\nreceived and carefully considered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President is not willing to uncover the capital entirely; and it is\\r\\nbelieved that, even if this were prudent, it would require more time to\\r\\neffect a junction between your army and that of the Rappahannock by\\r\\nthe way of the Potomac and York rivers than by a land march. In order,\\r\\ntherefore, to increase the strength of the attack upon Richmond at the\\r\\nearliest moment, General McDowell has been ordered to march upon that city\\r\\nby the shortest route. He is ordered, keeping himself always in position\\r\\nto save the capital from all possible attack, so to operate as to put his\\r\\nleft wing in communication with your right wing, and you are instructed\\r\\nto co-operate so as to establish this communication as soon as possible by\\r\\nextending your right-wing to the north of Richmond.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is believed that this communication can be safely established either\\r\\nnorth or south of the Pamunkey River.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn any event, you will be able to prevent the main body of the enemy\\'s\\r\\nforces from leaving Richmond and falling in overwhelming force upon\\r\\nGeneral McDowell. He will move with between thirty-five and forty thousand\\r\\nmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nA copy of the instructions to General McDowell are with this. The specific\\r\\ntask assigned to his command has been to provide against any danger to the\\r\\ncapital of the nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt your earnest call for reinforcements, he is sent forward to co-operate\\r\\nin the reduction of Richmond, but charged, in attempting this, not to\\r\\nuncover the city of Washington; and you will give no order, either before\\r\\nor after your junction, which can put him out of position to cover\\r\\nthis city. You and he will communicate with each other by telegraph or\\r\\notherwise as frequently as may be necessary for efficient cooperation.\\r\\nWhen General McDowell is in position on your right, his supplies must be\\r\\ndrawn from West Point, and you will instruct your staff-officers to be\\r\\nprepared to supply him by that route.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President desires that General McDowell retain the command of the\\r\\nDepartment of the Rappahannock and of the forces with which he moves\\r\\nforward.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy order of the President:  EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN, Commanding Army of the Potomac, before\\r\\nRichmond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPROCLAMATION REVOKING GENERAL HUNTER\\'S ORDER OF MILITARY EMANCIPATION,\\r\\n\\r\\nMAY 19, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\\r\\n\\r\\nA Proclamation\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereas there appears in the public prints what purports to be a\\r\\nproclamation of Major general Hunter, in the words and figures following,\\r\\nto wit:\\r\\n\\r\\n(General Orders No. 11) HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, HILTON HEAD,\\r\\nPORT ROYAL, S. C., May 9, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The three States of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina, comprising the\\r\\nmilitary department of the South, having deliberately declared themselves\\r\\nno longer under the protection of the United States of America, and\\r\\nhaving taken up arms against the said United States, it became a military\\r\\nnecessity to declare martial law. This was accordingly done on the\\r\\n25th day of April, 1862. Slavery and martial law in a free country are\\r\\naltogether incompatible. The persons in these three States: Georgia\\r\\nFlorida, and South Carolina--heretofore held as slaves are therefore\\r\\ndeclared forever free.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By command of Major-General D. Hunter: \"(Official.)ED. W. SMITH, \"Acting\\r\\nAssistant Adjutant-General.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd whereas the same is producing some excitement and misunderstanding:\\r\\ntherefore,\\r\\n\\r\\nI, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, proclaim and declare\\r\\nthat the Government of the United States, had no knowledge, information,\\r\\nor belief of an intention on the part of General Hunter to issue such a\\r\\nproclamation; nor has it yet any authentic information that the document\\r\\nis genuine. And further, that neither General Hunter nor any other\\r\\ncommander or person has been authorized by the Government of the United\\r\\nStates to make a proclamation declaring the slaves of any State free; and\\r\\nthat the supposed proclamation now in question, whether genuine or false,\\r\\nis altogether void so far as respects such a declaration.\\r\\n\\r\\nI further make known that whether it be competent for me, as\\r\\ncommander-in-chief of the army and navy, to declare the slaves of any\\r\\nState or States free, and whether, at any time, in any case, it shall have\\r\\nbecome a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the government to\\r\\nexercise such supposed power, are questions which under my responsibility\\r\\nI reserve to myself, and which I cannot feel justified in leaving to the\\r\\ndecision of commanders in the field.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are totally different questions from those of police regulations in\\r\\narmies and camps.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the sixth day of March last, by special message, I recommended to\\r\\nCongress the adoption of a joint resolution, to be substantially as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\n\\r\\nResolved, That the United States ought to co-operate with any State which\\r\\nmay adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such State pecuniary\\r\\naid, to be used by such State, in its discretion, to compensate for the\\r\\ninconvenience, public and private, produced by such change of system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resolution in the language above quoted was adopted by large\\r\\nmajorities in both branches of Congress, and now stands an authentic,\\r\\ndefinite, and solemn proposal of the nation to the States and people\\r\\nmost immediately interested in the subject-matter. To the people of those\\r\\nStates I now earnestly appeal. I do not argue--I beseech you to make\\r\\narguments for yourselves. You cannot, if you would, be blind to the signs\\r\\nof the times. I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them,\\r\\nranging, if it may be, far above personal and partisan politics. This\\r\\nproposal makes common cause for a common object, casting no reproaches\\r\\nupon any. It acts not the Pharisee. The change it contemplates would come\\r\\ngently as the dews of heaven, not rending or wrecking anything. Will you\\r\\nnot embrace it? So much good has not been done, by one effort, in all past\\r\\ntime, as in the providence of God it is now your high privilege to do. May\\r\\nthe vast future not have to lament that you have neglected it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\\r\\nUnited States to be affixed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDone at the city of Washington, this nineteenth day of May, in the year of\\r\\nour Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, and of the independence\\r\\nof the United States the eighty-sixth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

I wish to do this, and yet I\\r\\ndo not wish to be understood as rebuking you. Please answer at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON CITY, May 22, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\\r\\n\\r\\nYour long despatch of yesterday just received. You will have just such\\r\\ncontrol of General McDowell and his forces as you therein indicate.\\r\\nMcDowell can reach you by land sooner than he could get aboard of boats,\\r\\nif the boats were ready at Fredericksburg, unless his march shall be\\r\\nresisted, in which case the force resisting him will certainly not be\\r\\nconfronting you at Richmond. By land he can reach you in five days after\\r\\nstarting, whereas by water he would not reach you in two weeks, judging by\\r\\npast experience. Franklin\\'s single division did not reach you in ten days\\r\\nafter I ordered it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN,\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, May 24, 1862. 4 PM.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consequence of General Banks\\'s critical position, I have been compelled\\r\\nto suspend General McDowell\\'s movements to join you. The enemy are making\\r\\na desperate push upon Harper\\'s Ferry, and we are trying to throw General\\r\\nFremont\\'s force and part of General McDowell\\'s in their rear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN, President.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON May 24, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:\\r\\n\\r\\nI left General McDowell\\'s camp at dark last evening. Shields\\'s command is\\r\\nthere, but it is so worn that he cannot move before Monday morning, the\\r\\n26th. We have so thinned our line to get troops for other places that it\\r\\nwas broken yesterday at Front Royal, with a probable loss to us of one\\r\\nregiment infantry, two Companies cavalry, putting General Banks in some\\r\\nperil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enemy\\'s forces under General Anderson now opposing General McDowell\\'s\\r\\nadvance have as their line of supply and retreat the road to Richmond.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, in conjunction with McDowell\\'s movement against Anderson, you\\r\\ncould send a force from your right to cut off the enemy\\'s supplies from\\r\\nRichmond, preserve the railroad bridges across the two forks of the\\r\\nPamunkey, and intercept the enemy\\'s retreat, you will prevent the army\\r\\nnow opposed to you from receiving an accession of numbers of nearly 15,000\\r\\nmen; and if you succeed in saving the bridges you will secure a line of\\r\\nrailroad for supplies in addition to the one you now have. Can you not\\r\\ndo this almost as well as not while you are building the Chickahominy\\r\\nbridges? McDowell and Shields both say they can, and positively will, move\\r\\nMonday morning. I wish you to move cautiously and safely.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will have command of McDowell, after he joins you, precisely as you\\r\\nindicated in your long despatch to us of the 21st.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

This he says is\\r\\nreliable. He is also informed of large forces south of him. We know\\r\\na force of some 15,000 broke up Saturday night from in front of\\r\\nFredericksburg and went we know not where. Please inform us, if possible,\\r\\nwhat has become of the force which pursued Banks yesterday; also any other\\r\\ninformation you have.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

FREMONT.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862. 4 P.M.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Franklin:\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are authorized to purchase the 400 horses, or take them wherever or\\r\\nhowever you can get them. The exposed condition of General Banks makes\\r\\nhis immediate relief a point of paramount importance. You are therefore\\r\\ndirected by the President to move against Jackson at Harrisonburg and\\r\\noperate against the enemy in such way as to relieve Banks. This movement\\r\\nmust be made immediately. You will acknowledge the receipt of this order,\\r\\nand specify the hour it is received by you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

Much--perhaps all--depends upon the celerity with which\\r\\nyou can execute it. Put the utmost speed into it. Do not lose a minute.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

I beg you to be\\r\\nassured we do the best we can. I mean to cast no blame where I tell you\\r\\neach of our commanders along our line from Richmond to Corinth supposes\\r\\nhimself to be confronted by numbers superior to his own. Under this\\r\\npressure We thinned the line on the upper Potomac, until yesterday it was\\r\\nbroken with heavy loss to us, and General Banks put in great peril, out of\\r\\nwhich he is not yet extricated, and may be actually captured. We need men\\r\\nto repair this breach, and have them not at hand. My dear General, I feel\\r\\njustified to rely very much on you. I believe you and the brave officers\\r\\nand men with you can and will get the victory at Corinth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Fredricksburg:\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Fremont has been ordered by telegraph to move from Franklin on\\r\\nHarrisonburg to relieve General Banks, and capture or destroy Jackson\\'s\\r\\nand Ewell\\'s forces. You are instructed, laying aside for the present\\r\\nthe movement on Richmond, to put 20,000 men in motion at once for the\\r\\nShenandoah, moving on the line or in advance of the line of the Manassas\\r\\nGap railroad. Your object will be to capture the forces of Jackson and\\r\\nEwell, either in co-operation with General Fremont, or, in case want\\r\\nof supplies or of transportation, interferes with his movements, it is\\r\\nbelieved that the force which you move will be sufficient to accomplish\\r\\nthis object alone. The information thus far received here makes it\\r\\nprobable that if the enemy operate actively against General Banks, you\\r\\nwill not be able to count upon much assistance from him, but may even have\\r\\nto release him. Reports received this moment are that Banks is fighting\\r\\nwith Ewell eight miles from Winchester.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McDOWELL.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C., May 24, 1862\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL I. McDOWELL:\\r\\n\\r\\nI am highly gratified by your alacrity in obeying my order. The change was\\r\\nas painful to me as it can possibly be to you or to any one.

He is also threatening\\r\\nLeesburg and Geary, on the Manassas Gap railroad, from both north and\\r\\nsouth--in precisely what force we cannot tell. I think the movement is a\\r\\ngeneral and concerted one, such as would not be if he was acting upon the\\r\\npurpose of a very desperate defense of Richmond. I think the time is near\\r\\nwhen you must either attack Richmond or give up the job and come to the\\r\\ndefense of Washington. Let me hear from you instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

This justifies the inference\\r\\nthat he is pressed by numbers superior to his own. I think it not\\r\\nimprobable that Ewell, Jackson, and Johnson are pouring through the gap\\r\\nthey made day before yesterday at Front Royal, making a dash northward. It\\r\\nwill be a very valuable and very honorable service for General McDowell\\r\\nto cut them off. I hope he will put all possible energy and speed into the\\r\\neffort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

I did not mean to question the correctness of\\r\\nyour conduct; on the contrary! I approve what you have done.

C., May 25,1862. 8.30 P.M.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\\r\\n\\r\\nYour despatch received. General Banks was at Strasburg, with about 6,000\\r\\nmen, Shields having been taken from him to swell a column for McDowell\\r\\nto aid you at Richmond, and the rest of his force scattered at various\\r\\nplaces. On the 23d a rebel force of 7000 to 10,000 fell upon one regiment\\r\\nand two companies guarding the bridge at Front Royal, destroying it\\r\\nentirely; crossed the Shenandoah, and on the 24th (yesterday) pushed to\\r\\nget north of Banks, on the road to Winchester. Banks ran a race with them,\\r\\nbeating them into Winchester yesterday evening. This morning a battle\\r\\nensued between the two forces, in which Banks was beaten back into full\\r\\nretreat toward Martinsburg, and probably is broken up into a total rout.\\r\\nGeary, on the Manassas Gap railroad, just now reports that Jackson is\\r\\nnow near Front Royal, With 10,000, following up and supporting, as I\\r\\nunderstand, the forces now pursuing Banks, also that another force of\\r\\n10,000 is near Orleans, following on in the same direction. Stripped here,\\r\\nas we are here, it will be all we can do to prevent them crossing the\\r\\nPotomac at Harper\\'s Ferry or above. We have about 20,000 of McDowell\\'s\\r\\nforce moving back to the vicinity of Front Royal, and General Fremont, who\\r\\nwas at Franklin, is moving to Harrisonburg; both these movements intended\\r\\nto get in the enemy\\'s rear.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne more of McDowell\\'s brigades is ordered through here to Harper\\'s Ferry;\\r\\nthe rest of his force remains for the present at Fredericksburg. We are\\r\\nsending such regiments and dribs from here and Baltimore as we can spare\\r\\nto Harper\\'s Ferry, supplying their places in some sort by calling in\\r\\nmilitia from the adjacent States. We also have eighteen cannon on the\\r\\nroad to Harper\\'s Ferry, of which arm there is not a single one yet at that\\r\\npoint. This is now our situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf McDowell\\'s force was now beyond our reach, we should be utterly\\r\\nhelpless. Apprehension of something like this, and no unwillingness to\\r\\nsustain you, has always been my reason for withholding McDowell\\'s force\\r\\nfrom you. Please understand this, and do the best you can with the force\\r\\nyou have.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHISTORY OF CONSPIRACY OF REBELLION\\r\\n\\r\\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAY 16, 1862\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe insurrection which is yet existing in the United States and aims at\\r\\nthe overthrow of the Federal Constitution and the Union, was clandestinely\\r\\nprepared during the Winter of 1860 and 1861, and assumed an open\\r\\norganization in the form of a treasonable provisional government at\\r\\nMontgomery, in Alabama on the 18th day of February, 1861. On the 12th day\\r\\nof April, 1861, the insurgents committed the flagrant act of civil war by\\r\\nthe bombardment and the capture of Fort Sumter, Which cut off the hope of\\r\\nimmediate conciliation. Immediately afterward all the roads and avenues to\\r\\nthis city were obstructed, and the capital was put into the condition of\\r\\na siege. The mails in every direction were stopped and the lines of\\r\\ntelegraph cut off by the insurgents, and military and naval forces which\\r\\nhad been called out by the government for the defense of Washington were\\r\\nprevented from reaching the city by organized and combined treasonable\\r\\nresistance in the State of Maryland. There was no adequate and effective\\r\\norganization for the public defense. Congress had indefinitely adjourned.\\r\\nThere was no time to convene them. It became necessary for me to choose\\r\\nwhether, using only the existing means, agencies, and processes which\\r\\nCongress had provided, I should let the government fall at once into\\r\\nruin or whether, availing myself of the broader powers conferred by the\\r\\nConstitution in cases of insurrection, I would make an effort to save it,\\r\\nwith all its blessings, for the present age and for posterity.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thereupon summoned my constitutional advisers, the heads of all the\\r\\ndepartments, to meet on Sunday, the 20th day of April, 1861, at the\\r\\noffice of the Navy Department, and then and there, with their unanimous\\r\\nconcurrence, I directed that an armed revenue cutter should proceed to\\r\\nsea to afford protection to the commercial marine, and especially the\\r\\nCalifornia treasure ships then on their way to this coast. I also directed\\r\\nthe commandant of the navy-yard at Boston to purchase or charter and arm\\r\\nas quickly as possible five steamships for purposes of public defense. I\\r\\ndirected the commandant of the navy-yard at Philadelphia to purchase\\r\\nor charter and arm an equal number for the same purpose. I directed the\\r\\ncommandant at New York to purchase or charter and arm an equal number. I\\r\\ndirected Commander Gillis to purchase or charter and arm and put to sea\\r\\ntwo other vessels. Similar directions were given to Commodore Dupont,\\r\\nwith a view to the opening of passages by water to and from the capital.\\r\\nI directed the several officers to take the advice and obtain the aid and\\r\\nefficient services, in the matter, of his Excellency Edwin D. Morgan,\\r\\nthe Governor of New York, or in his absence George D. Morgan, William M.\\r\\nEvarts, R. M. Blatchford, and Moses H. Grinnell, who were by my directions\\r\\nespecially empowered by the Secretary of the Navy to act for his\\r\\ndepartment in that crisis in matters pertaining to the forwarding of\\r\\ntroops and supplies for the public defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe several departments of the government at that time contained so large\\r\\na number of disloyal persons that it would have been impossible to provide\\r\\nsafely through official agents only for the performance of the duties\\r\\nthus confided to citizens favorably known for their ability, loyalty, and\\r\\npatriotism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe several orders issued upon these occurrences were transmitted by\\r\\nprivate messengers, who pursued a circuitous way to the seaboard cities,\\r\\ninland across the States of Pennsylvania and Ohio and the northern lakes.\\r\\nI believe by these and other similar measures taken in that crisis, some\\r\\nof which were without any authority of law, the government was saved from\\r\\noverthrow. I am not aware that a dollar of the public funds thus confided\\r\\nwithout authority of law to unofficial persons was either lost or wasted,\\r\\nalthough apprehensions of such misdirection occurred to me as objections\\r\\nto those extraordinary proceedings, and were necessarily overruled.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recall these transactions now because my attention has been directed to\\r\\na resolution which was passed by the House of Representatives on the 30th\\r\\nday of last month, which is in these words:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Resolved, That Simon Cameron, late Secretary of War by investing\\r\\nAlexander Cummings with the control of large sums of the public money\\r\\nand authority to purchase military supplies without restriction, without\\r\\nrequiring from him any guaranty for the faithful performance of his\\r\\nduties, when the services of competent public officers were available, and\\r\\nby involving the government in a vast number of contracts with persons not\\r\\nlegitimately engaged in the business pertaining to the subject-matter of\\r\\nsuch contracts, especially in the purchase of arms for future delivery,\\r\\nhas adopted a policy highly injurious to the public service, and deserves\\r\\nthe censure of the House.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCongress will see that I should be wanting equally in candor and in\\r\\njustice if I should leave the censure expressed in this resolution to rest\\r\\nexclusively or chiefly upon Mr. Cameron. The same sentiment is unanimously\\r\\nentertained by the heads of department who participated in the proceedings\\r\\nwhich the House of Representatives have censured. It is due to Mr. Cameron\\r\\nto say that although he fully approved the proceedings they were not moved\\r\\nnor suggested by himself, and that not only the President, but all the\\r\\nother heads of departments, were at least equally responsible with him for\\r\\nwhatever error, wrong, or fault was committed in the premises.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

McDOWELL.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, May 28, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL McDOWELL, Manassas Junction:\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral McClellan at 6.30 P.M. yesterday telegraphed that Fitz-John\\r\\nPorter\\'s division had fought and driven 13,000 of the enemy, under General\\r\\nBranch, from Hanover Court-House, and was driving them from a stand they\\r\\nhad made on the railroad at the time the messenger left. Two hours later\\r\\nhe telegraphed that Stoneman had captured an engine and six cars on\\r\\nthe Virginia Central, which he at once sent to communicate with Porter.\\r\\nNothing further from McClellan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Porter effects a lodgment on both railroads near Hanover Court-House,\\r\\nconsider whether your forces in front of Fredericksburg should not push\\r\\nthrough and join him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

McDOWELL.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, May 28, 1862. 5.40 P.M.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL McDOWELL, Manassas Junction:\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the evidence now preponderates that Ewell and Jackson are still\\r\\nabout Winchester. Assuming this, it is for you a question of legs. Put in\\r\\nall the speed you can. I have told Fremont as much, and directed him to\\r\\ndrive at them as fast as possible. By the way, I suppose you know Fremont\\r\\nhas got up to Moorefield, instead of going into Harrisonburg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON May 28, 1862. 8.40 P.M.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very glad of General F. J. Porter\\'s victory. Still, if it was a\\r\\ntotal rout of the enemy, I am puzzled to know why the Richmond and\\r\\nFredericksburg railroad was not seized again, as you say you have all the\\r\\nrailroads but the Richmond and Fredericksburg. I am puzzled to see how,\\r\\nlacking that, you can have any, except the scrap from Richmond to\\r\\nWest Point. The scrap of the Virginia Central from Richmond to Hanover\\r\\nJunction, without more, is simply nothing. That the whole of the enemy is\\r\\nconcentrating on Richmond, I think cannot be certainly known to you or\\r\\nme. Saxton, at Harper\\'s Ferry informs us that large forces, supposed to be\\r\\nJackson\\'s and Ewells, forced his advance from Charlestown today. General\\r\\nKing telegraphs us from Fredericksburg that contrabands give certain\\r\\ninformation that 15,000 left Hanover Junction Monday morning to reinforce\\r\\nJackson. I am painfully impressed with the importance of the struggle\\r\\nbefore you, and shall aid you all I can consistently with my view of due\\r\\nregard to all points.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

MARCY, McClellan\\'s Headquarters:\\r\\n\\r\\nYours just received. I think it cannot be certainly known whether the\\r\\nforce which fought General Porter is the same which recently confronted\\r\\nMcDowell.

In your movement upon Chattanooga I think it\\r\\nprobable that you include some combination of the force near Cumberland\\r\\nGap under General Morgan.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

WASHINGTON, June 12, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:\\r\\n\\r\\nAccounts, which we do not credit, represent that Jackson is largely\\r\\nreinforced and turning upon you. Get your forces well in hand and keep us\\r\\nwell and frequently advised; and if you find yourself really pressed by a\\r\\nsuperior force of the enemy, fall back cautiously toward or to Winchester,\\r\\nand we will have in due time Banks in position to sustain you. Do not\\r\\nfall back upon Harrisonburg unless upon tolerably clear necessity. We\\r\\nunderstand Jackson is on the other side of the Shenandoah from you, and\\r\\nhence cannot in any event press you into any necessity of a precipitate\\r\\nwithdrawal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S.--Yours, preferring Mount Jackson to Harrisonburg, is just received.\\r\\nOn this point use your discretion, remembering that our object is to give\\r\\nsuch protection as you can to western Virginia. Many thanks to yourself,\\r\\nofficers, and men for the gallant battle of last Sunday. A.

The large\\r\\namount of valuable statistical information which is collated and presented\\r\\nin the memorial will greatly facilitate the mature consideration of the\\r\\nsubject, which I respectfully ask for it at your hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON; June 13. 1862\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot afford to keep your force and Banks\\'s and McDowell\\'s engaged\\r\\nin keeping Jackson south of Strasburg and Front Royal. You fought Jackson\\r\\nalone and worsted him. He can have no substantial reinforcements so long\\r\\nas a battle is pending at Richmond. Surely you and Banks in supporting\\r\\ndistance are capable of keeping him from returning to Winchester. But if\\r\\nSigel be sent forward to you, and McDowell (as he must) be put to other\\r\\nwork, Jackson will break through at Front Royal again. He is already on\\r\\nthe right side of the Shenandoah to do it, and on the wrong side of it to\\r\\nattack you. The orders already sent you and Banks place you and him in the\\r\\nproper positions for the work assigned you. Jackson cannot move his whole\\r\\nforce on either of you before the other can learn of it and go to his\\r\\nassistance. He cannot divide his force, sending part against each of you,\\r\\nbecause he will be too weak for either. Please do as I directed in the\\r\\norder of the 8th and my despatch of yesterday, the 12th, and neither you\\r\\nnor Banks will be overwhelmed by Jackson. By proper scout lookouts, and\\r\\nbeacons of smoke by day and fires by night you can always have timely\\r\\nnotice of the enemy\\'s approach. I know not as to you, but by some this has\\r\\nbeen too much neglected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., June 15, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your letter of the 12th by Colonel Zagonyi is just received.\\r\\nIn answer to the principal part of it, I repeat the substance of an order\\r\\nof the 8th and one or two telegraphic despatches sent you since.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have no definite power of sending reinforcements; so that we are\\r\\ncompelled rather to consider the proper disposal of the forces we have\\r\\nthan of those we could wish to have. We may be able to send you some dribs\\r\\nby degrees, but I do not believe we can do more. As you alone beat Jackson\\r\\nlast Sunday, I argue that you are stronger than he is to-day, unless he\\r\\nhas been reinforced; and that he cannot have been materially reinforced,\\r\\nbecause such reinforcement could only have come from Richmond, and he\\r\\nis much more likely to go to Richmond than Richmond is to come to him.\\r\\nNeither is very likely. I think Jackson\\'s game--his assigned work--now is\\r\\nto magnify the accounts of his numbers and reports of his movements, and\\r\\nthus by constant alarms keep three or four times as many of our troops\\r\\naway from Richmond as his own force amounts to. Thus he helps his friends\\r\\nat Richmond three or four times as much as if he were there. Our game is\\r\\nnot to allow this. Accordingly, by the order of the 8th, I directed you\\r\\nto halt at Harrisonburg, rest your force, and get it well in hand, the\\r\\nobjects being to guard against Jackson\\'s returning by the same route to\\r\\nthe upper Potomac over which you have just driven him out, and at the same\\r\\ntime give some protection against a raid into West Virginia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready I have given you discretion to occupy Mount Jackson instead,\\r\\nif, on full consideration, you think best. I do not believe Jackson will\\r\\nattack you, but certainly he cannot attack you by surprise; and if he\\r\\ncomes upon you in superior force, you have but to notify us, fall back\\r\\ncautiously, and Banks will join you in due time. But while we know not\\r\\nwhether Jackson will move at all, or by what route, we cannot safely put\\r\\nyou and Banks both on the Strasburg line, and leave no force on the Front\\r\\nRoyal line--the very line upon which he prosecuted his late raid. The true\\r\\npolicy is to place one of you on one line and the other on the other in\\r\\nsuch positions that you can unite once you actually find Jackson moving\\r\\nupon it. And this is precisely what we are doing. This protects that\\r\\npart of our frontier, so to speak, and liberates McDowell to go to the\\r\\nassistance of McClellan. I have arranged this, and am very unwilling to\\r\\nhave it deranged. While you have only asked for Sigel, I have spoken only\\r\\nof Banks, and this because Sigel\\'s force is now the principal part of\\r\\nBank\\'s force.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout transferring General Schenck\\'s commands, the purchase of supplies,\\r\\nand the promotion and appointment of officers, mentioned in your letter, I\\r\\nwill consult with the Secretary of War to-morrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, June 16, 1862\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Mount Jackson, Virginia:\\r\\n\\r\\nYour despatch of yesterday, reminding me of a supposed understanding\\r\\nthat I would furnish you a corps of 35,000 men, and asking of me the\\r\\n\"fulfilment of this understanding,\" is received. I am ready to come to a\\r\\nfair settlement of accounts with you on the fulfilment of understandings.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in March last, when I assigned you to the command of the Mountain\\r\\nDepartment, I did tell you I would give you all the force I could, and\\r\\nthat I hoped to make it reach 35,000. You at the same time told me that\\r\\nwithin a reasonable time you would seize the railroad at or east of\\r\\nKnoxville, Tenn., if you could. There was then in the department a force\\r\\nsupposed to be 25,000, the exact number as well known to you as to me.\\r\\nAfter looking about two or three days, you called and distinctly told\\r\\nme that if I would add the Blenker division to the force already in the\\r\\ndepartment, you would undertake the job. The Blenker division contained\\r\\n10,000, and at the expense of great dissatisfaction to General McClellan\\r\\nI took it from his army and gave it to you. My promise was literally\\r\\nfulfilled. I have given you all I could, and I have given you very nearly,\\r\\nif not quite, 35,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow for yours. On the 23d of May, largely over two months afterward, you\\r\\nwere at Franklin, Va., not within 300 miles of Knoxville, nor within 80\\r\\nmiles of any part of the railroad east of it, and not moving forward, but\\r\\ntelegraphing here that you could not move for lack of everything. Now,\\r\\ndo not misunderstand me. I do not say you have not done all you could. I\\r\\npresume you met unexpected difficulties; and I beg you to believe that as\\r\\nsurely as you have done your best, so have I. I have not the power now to\\r\\nfill up your Corps to 35,000. I am not demanding of you to do the work of\\r\\n35,000. I am only asking of you to stand cautiously on the defensive, get\\r\\nyour force in order, and give such protection as you can to the valley of\\r\\nthe Shenandoah and to western Virginia.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave you received the orders, and will you act upon them?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL C. SCHURZ.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, June 16, 1862\\r\\n\\r\\nBRIGADIER-GENERAL SCHURZ, Mount Jackson, Virginia:\\r\\n\\r\\nYour long letter is received. The information you give is valuable. You\\r\\nsay it is fortunate that Fremont did not intercept Jackson; that Jackson\\r\\nhad the superior force, and would have overwhelmed him. If this is so, how\\r\\nhappened it that Fremont fairly fought and routed him on the 8th? Or is\\r\\nthe account that he did fight and rout him false and fabricated? Both\\r\\nGeneral Fremont and you speak of Jackson having beaten Shields. By our\\r\\naccounts he did not beat Shields. He had no engagement with Shields. He\\r\\ndid meet and drive back with disaster about 2000 of Shields\\'s advance till\\r\\nthey were met by an additional brigade of Shields\\'s, when Jackson himself\\r\\nturned and retreated. Shields himself and more than half his force were\\r\\nnot nearer than twenty miles to any of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, June 18, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be of both interest and value to us here to know how the\\r\\nexpedition toward East Tennessee is progressing, if in your judgment you\\r\\ncan give us the information with safety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., June 18, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\\r\\n\\r\\nYours of to-day, making it probable that Jackson has been reinforced by\\r\\nabout 10,000 from Richmond, is corroborated by a despatch from General\\r\\nKing at Fredericksburg, saying a Frenchman, just arrived from Richmond by\\r\\nway of Gordonsville, met 10,000 to 15,000 passing through the latter place\\r\\nto join Jackson.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this is true, it is as good as a reinforcement to you of an equal\\r\\nforce. I could better dispose of things if I could know about what day you\\r\\ncan attack Richmond, and would be glad to be informed, if you think you\\r\\ncan inform me with safety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, JUNE 19, 1862\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\\r\\n\\r\\nYours of last night just received, and for which I thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf large reinforcements are going from Richmond to Jackson, it proves one\\r\\nof two things: either they are very strong at Richmond, or do not mean to\\r\\ndefend the place desperately.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reflection, I do not see how reinforcements from Richmond to Jackson\\r\\ncould be in Gordonsville, as reported by the Frenchman and your deserters.\\r\\nHave not all been sent to deceive?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

This\\r\\nmay be reality, and yet may only be contrivance for deception, and to\\r\\ndetermine which is perplexing. If we knew it was not true, we could send\\r\\nyou some more force; but as the case stands we do not think we safely can.\\r\\nStill, we will watch the signs and do so if possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn regard to a contemplated execution of Captains Spriggs and Triplett the\\r\\ngovernment has no information whatever, but will inquire and advise you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

McCLELLAN:\\r\\n\\r\\nYour despatch of yesterday (2 P. M.) was received this morning. If it\\r\\nwould not divert too much of your time and attention from the army under\\r\\nyour immediate command, I would be glad to have your views as to the\\r\\npresent state of military affairs throughout the whole country, as you say\\r\\nyou would be glad to give them. I would rather it should be by letter than\\r\\nby telegraph, because of the better chance of secrecy. As to the numbers\\r\\nand positions of the troops not under your command in Virginia and\\r\\nelsewhere, even if I could do it with accuracy, which I cannot, I would\\r\\nrather not transmit either by telegraph or by letter, because of the\\r\\nchances of its reaching the enemy. I would be very glad to talk with you,\\r\\nbut you cannot leave your camp, and I cannot well leave here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN, President\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL N. P.

You know my anxiety on that point.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll was quiet at General McClellan\\'s headquarters at two o\\'clock to-day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTREATY WITH MEXICO\\r\\n\\r\\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, June 23, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 7th day of December, 1861, I submitted to the Senate the project of\\r\\na treaty between the United States and Mexico which had been proposed to\\r\\nme by Mr. Corwin, our minister to Mexico, and respectfully requested the\\r\\nadvice of the Senate thereupon.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 25th day of February last a resolution was adopted by the Senate to\\r\\nthe effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That it is not advisable to negotiate a treaty that will require the\\r\\nUnited States to assume any portion of the principal or interest of the\\r\\ndebt of Mexico, or that will require the concurrence of European powers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis resolution having been duly communicated to me, notice thereof was\\r\\nimmediately given by the Secretary of State to Mr. Corwin, and he was\\r\\ninformed that he was to consider his instructions upon the subject\\r\\nreferred to modified by this resolution and would govern his course\\r\\naccordingly. That despatch failed to reach Mr. Corwin, by reason of the\\r\\ndisturbed condition of Mexico, until a very recent date, Mr. Corwin being\\r\\nwithout instructions, or thus practically left without instructions, to\\r\\nnegotiate further with Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn view of the very important events Occurring there, he has thought that\\r\\nthe interests of the United States would be promoted by the conclusion\\r\\nof two treaties which should provide for a loan to that republic. He has\\r\\ntherefore signed such treaties, and they having been duly ratified by the\\r\\nGovernment of Mexico, he has transmitted them to me for my consideration.\\r\\nThe action of the Senate is of course conclusive against an acceptance\\r\\nof the treaties On my part. I have, nevertheless, thought it just to our\\r\\nexcellent minister in Mexico and respectful to the Government of that\\r\\nrepublic to lay the treaties before the Senate, together with the\\r\\ncorrespondence which has occurred in relation to them. In performing this\\r\\nduty I have only to add that the importance of the subject thus submitted\\r\\nto the Senate, can not be over estimated, and I shall cheerfully receive\\r\\nand consider with the highest respect any further advice the Senate may\\r\\nthink proper to give upon the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVETO OF A CURRENCY BILL\\r\\n\\r\\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE, JUNE 23, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bill which has passed the House of Representatives and the Senate,\\r\\nentitled \"An act to repeal that part of an act of Congress which prohibits\\r\\nthe circulation of bank-notes of a less denomination than five dollars in\\r\\nthe District of Columbia,\" has received my attentive consideration, and\\r\\nI now return it to the Senate, in which it originated, with the following\\r\\nobjections:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The bill proposes to repeal the existing legislation prohibiting the\\r\\ncirculation of bank-notes of a less denomination than five dollars within\\r\\nthe District of Columbia, without permitting the issuing of such bills by\\r\\nbanks not now legally authorized to issue them. In my judgment, it will\\r\\nbe found impracticable, in the present condition of the currency, to make\\r\\nsuch a discrimination. The banks have generally suspended specie payments,\\r\\nand a legal sanction given to the circulation of the irredeemable notes\\r\\nof one class of them will almost certainly be so extended, in practical\\r\\noperation, as to include those of all classes, whether authorized or\\r\\nunauthorized. If this view be correct, the currency of the District,\\r\\nshould this act become a law, will certainly and greatly deteriorate, to\\r\\nthe serious injury of honest trade and honest labor.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. This bill seems to contemplate no end which cannot be otherwise\\r\\nmore certainly and beneficially attained. During the existing war it is\\r\\npeculiarly the duty of the National Government to secure to the people\\r\\na sound circulating medium. This duty has been, under existing\\r\\ncircumstances, satisfactorily performed, in part at least, by authorizing\\r\\nthe issue of United States notes, receivable for all government dues\\r\\nexcept customs, and made a legal tender for all debts, public and private,\\r\\nexcept interest on public debt. The object of the bill submitted to\\r\\nme--namely, that of providing a small note currency during the present\\r\\nsuspension--can be fully accomplished by authorizing the issue, as part\\r\\nof any new emission of United States notes made necessary by the\\r\\ncircumstances of the country, of notes of a similar character, but of\\r\\nless denomination than five dollars. Such an issue would answer all the\\r\\nbeneficial purposes of the bill, would save a considerable amount to the\\r\\ntreasury in interest, would greatly facilitate payments to soldiers and\\r\\nother creditors of small sums, and would furnish; to the people a currency\\r\\nas safe as their own government.\\r\\n\\r\\nEntertaining these objections to the bill, I feel myself constrained to\\r\\nwithhold from it my approval and return it for the further consideration\\r\\nand action of Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSPEECH AT JERSEY CITY, JUNE 24, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen birds and animals are looked at through a fog, they are seen to\\r\\ndisadvantage, and so it might be with you if I were to attempt to tell\\r\\nyou why I went to see General Scott. I can only say that my visit to West\\r\\nPoint did not have the importance which has been attached to it; but it\\r\\nconcerned matters that you understand quite as well as if I were to tell\\r\\nyou all about them. Now, I can only remark that it had nothing whatever\\r\\nto do with making or unmaking any general in the country. The Secretary of\\r\\nWar, you know, holds a pretty tight rein on the press, so that they shall\\r\\nnot tell more than they ought to; and I \\'m afraid that if I blab too much,\\r\\nhe might draw a tight rein on me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, June 26, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\\r\\n\\r\\nYour three despatches of yesterday in relation to the affair, ending with\\r\\nthe statement that you completely succeeded in making your point, are very\\r\\ngratifying.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe later one of 6.15 P.M., suggesting the probability of your\\r\\nbeing overwhelmed by two hundred thousand, and talking of where the\\r\\nresponsibility will belong, pains me very much. I give you all I can, and\\r\\nact on the presumption that you will do the best you can with what you\\r\\nhave, while you continue, ungenerously I think, to assume that I could\\r\\ngive you more if I would.

The Army of Virginia shall operate in such manner as, while protecting\\r\\nwestern Virginia and the national capital from danger or insult, it shall\\r\\nin the speediest manner attack and overcome the rebel forces under Jackson\\r\\nand Ewell, threaten the enemy in the direction of Charlottesville, and\\r\\nrender the most effective aid to relieve General McClellan and capture\\r\\nRichmond.\\r\\n\\r\\n4th. When the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Virginia shall be in\\r\\nposition to communicate and directly co-operate at or before Richmond, the\\r\\nchief command, while so operating together, shall be governed, as in like\\r\\ncases, by the Rules and Articles of War.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

It is believed\\r\\nthat the quickest route would be by way of Columbus, Ky., and up the Ohio\\r\\nRiver. But in detaching your force the President directs that it be done\\r\\nin such a way as to enable you to hold your ground and not interfere with\\r\\nthe movement against Chattanooga and East Tennessee. This condition being\\r\\nobserved, the forces to be detached and the routes they are to be sent are\\r\\nleft to your own judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe direction to send these forces immediately is rendered imperative by\\r\\na serious reverse suffered by General McClellan before Richmond yesterday,\\r\\nthe full extent of which is not yet known.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will acknowledge the receipt of this despatch, stating the day and\\r\\nhour it is received, and inform me what your action will be, so that we\\r\\nmay take measures to aid in river and railroad transportation.\\r\\n\\r\\nEDWIN M.

Will send reinforcements as fast as we can.\\r\\nOf course they cannot reach you to-day, to-morrow, or next day. I have not\\r\\nsaid you were ungenerous for saying you needed reinforcements. I thought\\r\\nyou were ungenerous in assuming that I did not send them as fast as I\\r\\ncould. I feel any misfortune to you and your army quite as keenly as you\\r\\nfeel it yourself. If you have had a drawn battle, or a repulse, it is\\r\\nthe price we pay for the enemy not being in Washington. We protected\\r\\nWashington, and the enemy concentrated on you. Had we stripped Washington,\\r\\nhe would have been upon us before the troops could have gotten to you.\\r\\nLess than a week ago you notified us that reinforcements were leaving\\r\\nRichmond to come in front of us. It is the nature of the case, and neither\\r\\nyou nor the government is to blame. Please tell at once the present\\r\\ncondition and aspect of things.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, June 28, 1862\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. W. H. SEWARD.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--My view of the present condition of the war is about as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evacuation of Corinth and our delay by the flood in the Chickahominy\\r\\nhave enabled the enemy to concentrate too much force in Richmond\\r\\nfor McClellan to successfully attack. In fact there soon will be no\\r\\nsubstantial rebel force anywhere else. But if we send all the force from\\r\\nhere to McClellan, the enemy will, before we can know of it, send a force\\r\\nfrom Richmond and take Washington. Or if a large part of the western army\\r\\nbe brought here to McClellan, they will let us have Richmond, and retake\\r\\nTennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, etc. What should be done is to hold what\\r\\nwe have in the West, open the Mississippi, and take Chattanooga and East\\r\\nTennessee without more. A reasonable force should in every event be\\r\\nkept about Washington for its protection. Then let the country give us a\\r\\nhundred thousand new troops in the shortest possible time, which, added to\\r\\nMcClellan directly or indirectly, will take Richmond without endangering\\r\\nany other place which we now hold, and will substantially end the war.\\r\\nI expect to maintain this contest until successful, or till I die, or am\\r\\nconquered, or my term expires, or Congress or the country forsake me; and\\r\\nI would publicly appeal to the country for this new force were it not that\\r\\nI fear a general panic and stampede would follow, so hard it is to have a\\r\\nthing understood as it really is. I think the new force should be all, or\\r\\nnearly all, infantry, principally because such can be raised most cheaply\\r\\nand quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. A. DIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., June 28,1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL DIX:\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunication with McClellan by White House is cut off.

Do what you can for him with gunboats at or\\r\\nnear that place. McClellan\\'s main force is between the Chickahominy and\\r\\nthe James. Also do what you can to communicate with him and support him\\r\\nthere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo GOVERNOR MORTON.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C. June 28, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGOVERNOR O. P. MORTON, Indianapolis, Ind:\\r\\n\\r\\nYour despatch of to-day is just received. I have no recollection of either\\r\\nJohn R. Cravens or Cyrus M. Allen having been named to me for appointment\\r\\nunder the tax law. The latter particularly has been my friend, and I am\\r\\nsorry to learn that he is not yours. No appointment has been or will be\\r\\nmade by me for the purpose of stabbing you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY SEWARD.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, June 29, 1862.6 P.M.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Astor House, New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nNot much more than when you left. Fulton of Baltimore American is now with\\r\\nus. He left White House at 11 A.M. yesterday. He conversed fully with a\\r\\npaymaster who was with Porter\\'s force during the fight of Friday and fell\\r\\nback to nearer McClellan\\'s quarters just a little sooner than Porter did,\\r\\nseeing the whole of it; stayed on the Richmond side of the Chickahominy\\r\\nover night, and left for White House at 5 A.M. Saturday. He says Porter\\r\\nretired in perfect order under protection of the guns arranged for the\\r\\npurpose, under orders and not from necessity; and with all other of our\\r\\nforces, except what was left on purpose to go to White House, was safely\\r\\nin pontoons over the Chickahominy before morning, and that there was heavy\\r\\nfiring on the Richmond side, begun at 5 and ceased at 7 A.M. Saturday. On\\r\\nthe whole, I think we have had the better of it up to that point of time.\\r\\nWhat has happened since we still know not, as we have no communication\\r\\nwith General McClellan. A despatch from Colonel Ingalls shows that he\\r\\nthinks McClellan is fighting with the enemy at Richmond to-day, and will\\r\\nbe to-morrow. We have no means of knowing upon what Colonel Ingalls founds\\r\\nhis opinion. Confirmed about saving all property. Not a single unwounded\\r\\nstraggler came back to White House from the field, and the number of\\r\\nwounded reaching there up to 11 A.M. Saturday was not large.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo what the President has above stated I will only add one or two points\\r\\nthat may be satisfactory for you to know.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst. All the sick and wounded were safely removed\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond. A despatch from Burnside shows that he is from White House; not a\\r\\nman left behind in condition to afford efficient support, and is probably\\r\\ndoing so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird. The despatch from Colonel Ingalls impresses me with the conviction\\r\\nthat the movement was made by General McClellan to concentrate on\\r\\nRichmond, and was successful to the latest point of which we have any\\r\\ninformation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth. Mr. Fulton says that on Friday night, between twelve and one\\r\\no\\'clock, General McClellan telegraphed Commodore Goldsborough that the\\r\\nresult of the movement was satisfactory to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifth. From these and the facts stated by the President, my inference is\\r\\nthat General McClellan will probably be in Richmond within two days.\\r\\n\\r\\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Unfortunately McClellan did not do any of the things he was ordered, and\\r\\nthat it was very likely possible to do. It is still some mystery what he\\r\\nwas doing all these days other than hiding in the woods and staying out of\\r\\ncommunication so he would not receive any more uncomfortable orders. This\\r\\nwas another place where the North was close to wining the war and did not.\\r\\nD.W.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY SEWARD. WAR DEPARTMENT, June 30, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. WM. H. SEWARD, New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are yet without communication with General McClellan, and this absence\\r\\nof news is our point of anxiety. Up to the latest point to which we are\\r\\nposted he effected everything in such exact accordance with his plan,\\r\\ncontingently announced to us before the battle began, that we feel\\r\\njustified to hope that he has not failed since. He had a severe engagement\\r\\nin getting the part of his army on this side of the Chickahominy over to\\r\\nthe other side, in which the enemy lost certainly as much as we did. We\\r\\nare not dissatisfied with this, only that the loss of enemies does not\\r\\ncompensate for the loss of friends. The enemy cannot come below White\\r\\nHouse; certainly is not there now, and probably has abandoned the whole\\r\\nline. Dix\\'s pickets are at New Kent Court-House.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCALL FOR TROOPS. NEW YORK, June 30, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE GOVERNORS OF THE SEVERAL STATES:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe capture of New Orleans, Norfolk, and Corinth by the national forces\\r\\nhas enabled the insurgents to concentrate a large force at and about\\r\\nRichmond, which place we must take with the least possible delay; in fact,\\r\\nthere will soon be no formidable insurgent force except at Richmond.\\r\\nWith so large an army there, the enemy can threaten us on the Potomac and\\r\\nelsewhere. Until we have re-established the national authority, all these\\r\\nplaces must be held, and we must keep a respectable force in front of\\r\\nWASHINGTON. But this, from the diminished strength of our army by sickness\\r\\nand casualties, renders an addition to it necessary in order to close the\\r\\nstruggle which has been prosecuted for the last three months with energy\\r\\nand success. Rather than hazard the misapprehension of our military\\r\\ncondition and of groundless alarm by a call for troops by proclamation, I\\r\\nhave deemed it best to address you in this form. To accomplish the object\\r\\nstated we require without delay 150,000 men, including those recently\\r\\ncalled for by the Secretary of War. Thus reinforced our gallant army will\\r\\nbe enabled to realize the hopes and expectations of the government and the\\r\\npeople.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. A. DIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, June 30, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL Dix, Fort Monroe:\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it not probable that the enemy has abandoned the line between White\\r\\nHouse and McClellan\\'s rear? He could have but little object to maintain\\r\\nit, and nothing to subsist upon. Would not Stoneman better move up and\\r\\nsee about it? I think a telegraphic communication can at once be opened to\\r\\nWhite House from Williamsburg. The wires must be up still.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAMS TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, JUNE 30, 1862. 3 P. M.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth:\\r\\n\\r\\nYour telegram of this date just received. The Chattanooga expedition\\r\\nmust not on any account be given up. The President regards that and the\\r\\nmovement against East Tennessee as one of the most important movements\\r\\nof the war, and its occupation nearly as important as the capture of\\r\\nRichmond. He is not pleased with the tardiness of the movement toward\\r\\nChattanooga, and directs that no force be sent here if you cannot do it\\r\\nwithout breaking up the operations against that point and East Tennessee.\\r\\nInfantry only are needed; our cavalry and artillery are strong enough.\\r\\nThe first reports from Richmond were more discouraging than the truth\\r\\nwarranted. If the advantage is not on our side, it is balanced. General\\r\\nMcClellan has moved his whole force on the line of the James River, and\\r\\nis supported there by our gunboats; but he must be largely strengthened\\r\\nbefore advancing, and hence the call on you, which I am glad you answered\\r\\nso promptly. Let me know to what point on the river you will send your\\r\\nforces, so as to provide immediately for transportation.\\r\\n\\r\\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\\r\\n\\r\\nSecretary of War.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, D.C., June 30, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi:\\r\\n\\r\\nWould be very glad of 25,000 infantry; no artillery or cavalry; but please\\r\\ndo not send a man if it endangers any place you deem important to hold,\\r\\nor if it forces you to give up or weaken or delay the expedition against\\r\\nChattanooga. To take and hold the railroad at or east of Cleveland, in\\r\\nEast Tennessee, I think fully as important as the taking and holding of\\r\\nRichmond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

All believe that the\\r\\ndecisive moment is near at hand, and to that end the people of the United\\r\\nStates are desirous to aid promptly in furnishing all reinforcements that\\r\\nyou may deem needful to sustain our government.\\r\\n\\r\\n     ISRAEL WASHBURN, JR., Governor of Maine.\\r\\n     H.

LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, D. C. July 1, 1862\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, JULY 1,1862. 3.30 P.M.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is impossible to reinforce you for your present emergency. If we had a\\r\\nmillion of men, We could not get them to you in time. We have not the men\\r\\nto send. If you are not strong enough to face the enemy, you must find a\\r\\nplace of security, and wait, rest, and repair. Maintain your ground if\\r\\nyou can, but save the army at all events, even if you fall back to Fort\\r\\nMonroe. We still have strength enough in the country, and will bring it\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., July 2, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\\r\\n\\r\\nYour despatch of Tuesday morning induces me to hope your army is having\\r\\nsome rest. In this hope allow me to reason with you a moment. When you ask\\r\\nfor 50,000 men to be promptly sent you, you surely labor under some gross\\r\\nmistake of fact. Recently you sent papers showing your disposal of forces\\r\\nmade last spring for the defense of WASHINGTON, and advising a return to\\r\\nthat plan. I find it included in and about WASHINGTON 75,000 men. Now,\\r\\nplease be assured I have not men enough to fill that very plan by 15,000.\\r\\nAll of Fremont\\'s in the valley, all of Banks\\'s, all of McDowell\\'s not with\\r\\nyou, and all in WASHINGTON, taken together, do not exceed, if they reach,\\r\\n60,000. With Wool and Dix added to those mentioned, I have not, outside of\\r\\nyour army, 75,000 men east of the mountains. Thus the idea of sending you\\r\\n50,000, or any other considerable force, promptly, is simply absurd. If,\\r\\nin your frequent mention of responsibility, you have the impression that\\r\\nI blame you for not doing more than you can, please be relieved of\\r\\nsuch impression. I only beg that in like manner you will not ask\\r\\nimpossibilities of me. If you think you are not strong enough to take\\r\\nRichmond just now, I do not ask you to try just now. Save the army,\\r\\nmaterial and personal, and I will strengthen it for the offensive again\\r\\nas fast as I can. The governors of eighteen States offer me a new levy of\\r\\n300,000, which I accept.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, D.C. July 2, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi:\\r\\n\\r\\nYour several despatches of yesterday to Secretary of War and myself\\r\\nreceived. I did say, and now repeat, I would be exceedingly glad for some\\r\\nreinforcements from you. Still do not send a man if in your judgment it\\r\\nwill endanger any point you deem important to hold, or will force you to\\r\\ngive up or weaken or delay the Chattanooga expedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease tell me could you not make me a flying visit for consultation\\r\\nwithout endangering the Service in your department.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

If I had 50,000 additional\\r\\ntroops here now, I believe I could substantially close the war in two\\r\\nweeks. But time is everything, and if I get 50,000 new men in a month, I\\r\\nshall have lost 20,000 old ones during the same month, having gained only\\r\\n30,000, with the difference between old and new troops still against me.\\r\\nThe quicker you send, the fewer you will have to send. Time is everything.\\r\\nPlease act in view of this. The enemy having given up Corinth, it is not\\r\\nwonderful that he is thereby enabled to check us for a time at Richmond.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

McCLELLAN:\\r\\n\\r\\nYours of 5.30 yesterday is just received. I am satisfied that yourself,\\r\\nofficers, and men have done the best you could. All accounts say better\\r\\nfighting was never done. Ten thousand thanks for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 28th we sent General Burnside an order to send all the force he\\r\\ncould spare to you. We then learned that you had requested him to go to\\r\\nGoldsborough; upon which we said to him our order was intended for your\\r\\nbenefit, and we did not wish to be in conflict with your views.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hope you will have help from him soon. Today we have ordered General\\r\\nHunter to send you all he can spare. At last advices General Halleck\\r\\nthinks he cannot send reinforcements without endangering all he has\\r\\ngained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN, President\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL G.

In addition to that arrived and\\r\\nnow arriving from the Potomac (about 10,000 men, I suppose), and about\\r\\n10,000 I hope you will have from Burnside very soon, and about 5000 from\\r\\nHunter a little later, I do not see how I can send you another man within\\r\\na month. Under these circumstances the defensive for the present must be\\r\\nyour only care. Save the army first, where you are, if you can; secondly,\\r\\nby removal, if you must. You, on the ground, must be the judge as to which\\r\\nyou will attempt, and of the means for effecting it. I but give it as my\\r\\nopinion that with the aid of the gunboats and the reinforcements mentioned\\r\\nabove you can hold your present position--provided, and so long as,\\r\\nyou can keep the James River open below you. If you are not tolerably\\r\\nconfident you can keep the James River open, you had better remove as soon\\r\\nas possible. I do not remember that you have expressed any apprehension as\\r\\nto the danger of having your communication cut on the river below you, yet\\r\\nI do not suppose it can have escaped your attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

HALLECK.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C., July 6, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--This introduces Governor William Sprague, of Rhode Island.\\r\\nHe is now Governor for the third time, and senator-elect of the United\\r\\nStates.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know the object of his visit to you. He has my cheerful consent to go,\\r\\nbut not my direction. He wishes to get you and part of your force, one or\\r\\nboth, to come here. You already know I should be exceedingly glad of\\r\\nthis if, in your judgment, it could be without endangering positions and\\r\\noperations in the southwest; and I now repeat what I have more than once\\r\\nsaid by telegraph: \"Do not come or send a man if, in your judgment, it\\r\\nwill endanger any point you deem important to hold, or endangers or delays\\r\\nthe Chattanooga expedition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, please give my friend, Governor Sprague, a full and fair hearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMEMORANDUM OF AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL McCLELLAN\\r\\n\\r\\nAND OTHER OFFICERS DURING A VISIT TO THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC AT HARRISON\\'S\\r\\nLANDING, VIRGINIA.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 9, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: What amount of force have you now?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL McCLELLAN: About 80,000, can\\'t vary much, certainly 75,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT:[to the corps commanders] What is the whole amount of your\\r\\ncorps with you now.\\r\\n\\r\\n     GENERAL SUMNER: About 15,000.\\r\\n     GENERAL HEINTZELMAN: 15,000 for duty.\\r\\n     GENERAL KEYES: About 12,500.\\r\\n     GENERAL PORTER: About 23,000--fully 20,000 fit for duty.\\r\\n     GENERAL FRANKLIN: About 15,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: What is likely to be your condition as to health in this\\r\\ncamp?\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL McCLELLAN: Better than in any encampment since landing at Fortress\\r\\nMonroe.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRESIDENT LINCOLN:[to the corps commanders] In your present encampment\\r\\nwhat is the present and prospective condition as to health?\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL SUMNER: As good as any part of Western Virginia.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Excellent for health, and present health improving.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL KEYES: A little improved, but think camp is getting worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL PORTER: Very good.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL FRANKLIN: Not good.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Where is the enemy now?\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL McCLELLAN: From four to five miles from us on all the roads--I\\r\\nthink nearly the whole army--both Hills, Longstreet, Jackson, Magruder,\\r\\nHuger.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: [to the corps commanders] Where and in what condition do\\r\\nyou believe the enemy to be now?\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL SUMNER: I think they have retired from our front; were very\\r\\nmuch damaged, especially in their best troops, in the late actions, from\\r\\nsuperiority of arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Don\\'t think they are in force in our vicinity.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL KEYES: Think he has withdrawn, and think preparing to go to\\r\\nWASHINGTON.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL PORTER: Believe he is mainly near Richmond. He feels he dare not\\r\\nattack us here.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL FRANKLIN: I learn he has withdrawn from our front and think that\\r\\nis probable.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: [to the corps commanders] What is the aggregate of your\\r\\nkilled, wounded, and missing from the attack on the 26th ultimo till now?\\r\\n\\r\\n     GENERAL SUMNER:   1175.\\r\\n     GENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Not large 745.\\r\\n     GENERAL KEYES: Less than 500.\\r\\n     GENERAL PORTER:    Over 5000.\\r\\n     GENERAL FRANKLIN: Not over 3000.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: If you desired could you remove the army safely?\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL McCLELLAN: It would be a delicate and very difficult matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: [to the corps commanders] If it were desired to get the\\r\\narmy away, could it be safely effected?\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL SUMNER: I think we could, but I think we give up the cause if we\\r\\ndo.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Perhaps we could, but I think it would be ruinous to\\r\\nthe country.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL KEYES: I think it could if done quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL PORTER: Impossible--move the army and ruin the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL FRANKLIN: I think we could, and that we had better--think\\r\\nRappahannock the true line.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: [to the corps commanders] Is the army secure in its present\\r\\nposition?\\r\\n\\r\\n    GENERAL SUMNER: Perfectly so, in my judgment.\\r\\n    GENERAL HEINTZELMAN: I think it is safe.\\r\\n    GENERAL KEYES: With help of General B. [Burnside] can hold position.\\r\\n    GENERAL PORTER: Perfectly so. Not only, but we are ready to begin\\r\\n                    moving forward.\\r\\n    GENERAL FRANKLIN: Unless river can be closed it is.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nORDER MAKING HALLECK GENERAL-IN-CHIEF.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 11,1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrdered, That Major-General Henry W. Halleck be assigned to command the\\r\\nwhole land forces of the United States, as general-in-chief, and that he\\r\\nrepair to this capital so soon as he can with safety to the positions and\\r\\noperations within the department now under his charge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nORDER CONCERNING THE SOUTHWEST BRANCH OF THE PACIFIC RAILROAD.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereas, in the judgment of the President, the public safety does require\\r\\nthat the railroad line called and known as the Southwest Branch of the\\r\\nPacific Railroad in the State of Missouri be repaired, extended, and\\r\\ncompleted from Rolla to Lebanon, in the direction to Springfield, in the\\r\\nsaid State, the same being necessary to the successful and economical\\r\\nconduct of the war and to the maintenance of the authority of the\\r\\ngovernment in the Southwest:\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, under and in virtue of the act of Congress entitled \"An act\\r\\nto authorize the President of the United States in certain cases to take\\r\\npossession of railroad and telegraph lines, and for other purposes,\"\\r\\napproved January 31, 1862, it is ordered, That the portion of the said\\r\\nrailroad line which reaches from Rolla to Lebanon be repaired, extended,\\r\\nand completed, so as to be made available for the military uses of the\\r\\ngovernment, as speedily as may be. And, inasmuch as upon the part of the\\r\\nsaid line from Rolla to the stream called Little Piney a considerable\\r\\nportion of the necessary work has already been done by the railroad\\r\\ncompany, and the road to this extent may be completed at comparatively\\r\\nsmall cost, it is ordered that the said line from Rolla to and across\\r\\nLittle Piney be first completed, and as soon as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secretary of War is charged with the execution of this order. And\\r\\nto facilitate the speedy execution of the work, he is directed, at his\\r\\ndiscretion, to take possession and control of the whole or such part of\\r\\nthe said railroad line, and the whole or such part of the rolling stock,\\r\\noffices, shops, buildings, and all their appendages and appurtenances, as\\r\\nhe may judge necessary or convenient for the early completion of the road\\r\\nfrom Rolla to Lebanon.\\r\\n\\r\\nDone at the city of WASHINGTON, July 11, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, D C., July 11, 1862\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\\r\\n\\r\\nI recommend that the thanks of Congress be given to the following officers\\r\\nof the United States Navy:\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain James L. Lardner, for meritorious conduct at the battle of Port\\r\\nRoyal and distinguished services on the coast of the United States against\\r\\nthe enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Charles Henry Davis, for distinguished services in conflict with\\r\\nthe enemy at Fort Pillow, at Memphis, and for successful operations at\\r\\nother points in the waters of the Mississippi River.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommander John A. Dahlgren, for distinguished services in the line of his\\r\\nprofession, improvements in ordnance, and zealous and efficient labors in\\r\\nthe ordnance branch of the service.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommander Stephen C. Rowan, for distinguished services in the waters of\\r\\nNorth Carolina, and particularly in the capture of Newbern, being in chief\\r\\ncommand of the naval forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommander David D. Porter, for distinguished services in the conception\\r\\nand preparation of the means used for the capture of the forts below\\r\\nNew Orleans, and for highly meritorious conduct in the management of the\\r\\nmortar flotilla during the bombardment of Forts Jackson and St. Philip.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Silas H. Stringharn, now on the retired list, for distinguished\\r\\nservices in the capture of Forts Hatteras and Clark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON. WAR DEPARTMENT, July 11, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. ANDREW JOHNSON.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of yesterday is received. Do you not, my good friend,\\r\\nperceive that what you ask is simply to put you in command in the West?\\r\\nI do not suppose you desire this. You only wish to control in your own\\r\\nlocalities; but this you must know may derange all other posts. Can\\r\\nyou not, and will you not, have a full conference with General Halleck?\\r\\nTelegraph him, and meet him at such place as he and you can agree upon. I\\r\\ntelegraph him to meet you and confer fully with you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK. WAR DEPARTMENT, July 11, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth:\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor Johnson, at Nashville, is in great trouble and anxiety about a\\r\\nraid into Kentucky. The governor is a true and valuable man--indispensable\\r\\nto us in Tennessee. Will you please get in communication with him,\\r\\nand have a full conference with him before you leave for here? I have\\r\\ntelegraphed him on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAPPEAL TO BORDER-STATES IN FAVOR OF COMPENSATED EMANCIPATION.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 12, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEMEN:--After the adjournment of Congress now very near, I shall have\\r\\nno opportunity of seeing you for several months. Believing that you of\\r\\nthe border States hold more power for good than any other equal number of\\r\\nmembers, I feel it a duty which I cannot justifiably waive to make this\\r\\nappeal to you. I intend no reproach or complaint when I assure you\\r\\nthat, in my opinion, if you all had voted for the resolution in the\\r\\ngradual-emancipation message of last March, the war would now be\\r\\nsubstantially ended. And the plan therein proposed is yet one of the most\\r\\npotent and swift means of ending it. Let the States which are in rebellion\\r\\nsee definitely and certainly that in no event will the States you\\r\\nrepresent ever join their proposed confederacy, and they cannot much\\r\\nlonger maintain the contest. But you cannot divest them of their hope\\r\\nto ultimately have you with them so long as you show a determination to\\r\\nperpetuate the institution within your own States. Beat them at elections,\\r\\nas you have overwhelmingly done, and, nothing daunted, they still claim\\r\\nyou as their own. You and I know what the lever of their power is. Break\\r\\nthat lever before their faces, and they can shake you no more forever.\\r\\nMost of you have treated me with kindness and consideration and I trust\\r\\nyou will not now think I improperly touch what is exclusively your own,\\r\\nwhen, for the sake of the whole country, I ask, Can you, for your States,\\r\\ndo better than to take the course I urge? Discarding punctilio and maxims\\r\\nadapted to more manageable times, and looking only to the unprecedentedly\\r\\nstern facts of our case, can you do better in any possible event? You\\r\\nprefer that the constitutional relation of the States to the nation shall\\r\\nbe practically restored without disturbance of the institution; and if\\r\\nthis were done, my whole duty in this respect, under the Constitution\\r\\nand my oath of office, would be performed. But it is not done, and we\\r\\nare trying to accomplish it by war. The incidents of the war cannot be\\r\\navoided. If the war continues long, as it must if the object be not sooner\\r\\nattained, the institution in your States will be extinguished by mere\\r\\nfriction and abrasion--by the mere incidents of the war. It will be gone,\\r\\nand you will have nothing valuable in lieu of it. Much of its value is\\r\\ngone already. How much better for you and for your people to take the step\\r\\nwhich at once shortens the war and secures substantial compensation for\\r\\nthat which is sure to be wholly lost in any other event! How much better\\r\\nto thus save the money which else we sink forever in war! How much better\\r\\nto do it while we can, lest the war ere long render us pecuniarily unable\\r\\nto do it! How much better for you as seller, and the nation as buyer, to\\r\\nsell out and buy out that without which the war could never have been,\\r\\nthan to sink both the thing to be sold and the price of it in cutting\\r\\none another\\'s throats! I do not speak of emancipation at once, but of\\r\\na decision at once to emancipate gradually. Room in South America for\\r\\ncolonization can be obtained cheaply and in abundance, and when numbers\\r\\nshall be large enough to be company and encouragement for one another, the\\r\\nfreed people will not be so reluctant to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am pressed with a difficulty not yet mentioned--one which threatens\\r\\ndivision among those who, united, are none too strong. An instance of it\\r\\nis known to you. General Hunter is an honest man. He was, and I hope still\\r\\nis, my friend. I valued him none the less for his agreeing with me in the\\r\\ngeneral wish that all men everywhere could be free. He proclaimed all men\\r\\nfree within certain States, and I repudiated the proclamation. He expected\\r\\nmore good and less harm from the measure than I could believe would\\r\\nfollow. Yet, in repudiating it, I gave dissatisfaction, if not offence, to\\r\\nmany whose support the country cannot afford to lose. And this is not\\r\\nthe end of it. The pressure in this direction is still upon me, and is\\r\\nincreasing. By conceding what I now ask you can relieve me, and, much\\r\\nmore, can relieve the country in this important point.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon these considerations, I have again begged your attention to the\\r\\nmessage of March last. Before leaving the Capital, consider and discuss it\\r\\namong yourselves. You are patriots and statesmen, and as such I pray\\r\\nyou consider this proposition; and, at the least, commend it to the\\r\\nconsideration of your States and people. As you would perpetuate popular\\r\\ngovernment for the best people in the world, I beseech you that you do\\r\\nin nowise omit this. Our common country is in great peril, demanding the\\r\\nloftiest views and boldest action to bring a speedy relief. Once relieved,\\r\\nits form of government is saved to the world; its beloved history and\\r\\ncherished memories are vindicated, and its happy future fully assured\\r\\nand rendered inconceivably grand. To you, more than to any others, the\\r\\nprivilege is given to assure that happiness and swell that grandeur, and\\r\\nto link your own names therewith forever.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 13, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am told that over 160,000 men have gone into your army\\r\\non the Peninsula. When I was with you the other day we made out 86,500\\r\\nremaining, leaving 73,500 to be accounted for. I believe 23,500 will cover\\r\\nall the killed, wounded, and missing in all your battles and skirmishes,\\r\\nleaving 50,000 who have left otherwise. No more than 5000 of these have\\r\\ndied, leaving 45,000 of your army still alive and not with it. I believe\\r\\nhalf or two-thirds of them are fit for duty to-day. Have you any more\\r\\nperfect knowledge of this than I have? If I am right, and you had these\\r\\nmen with you, you could go into Richmond in the next three days. How can\\r\\nthey be got to you, and how can they be prevented from getting away in\\r\\nsuch numbers for the future?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H.

July 17, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\\r\\n\\r\\nI have inadvertently omitted so long to inform you that in March last Mr.\\r\\nCornelius Vanderbilt, of New York, gratuitously presented to the United\\r\\nStates the ocean steamer Vanderbilt, by many esteemed the finest merchant\\r\\nship in the world. She has ever since been and still is doing valuable\\r\\nservice to the government. For the patriotic act of making this\\r\\nmagnificent and valuable present to the country I recommend that some\\r\\nsuitable acknowledgment be made.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS. July 17, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering the bill for \"An act to suppress insurrection, to punish\\r\\ntreason and rebellion, to seize and confiscate the property of rebels, and\\r\\nfor other purposes,\" and the joint resolution explanatory of said act as\\r\\nbeing substantially one, I have approved and signed both.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I was informed of the passage of the resolution I had prepared the\\r\\ndraft of a message stating objections to the bill becoming a law, a copy\\r\\nof which draft is herewith transmitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\\r\\n\\r\\nI herewith return to your honorable body, in which it originated, the bill\\r\\nfor an act entitled \"An act to suppress treason and rebellion, to seize\\r\\nand confiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes,\" together\\r\\nwith my objections to its becoming a law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is much in the bill to which I perceive no objection. It is wholly\\r\\nprospective, and touches neither person nor property of any loyal citizen,\\r\\nin which particulars it is just and proper. The first and second sections\\r\\nprovide for the conviction and punishment of persons Who shall be guilty\\r\\nof treason and persons who shall \"incite, set on foot, assist, or engage\\r\\nin any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United\\r\\nStates or the laws thereof, or shall give aid and comfort thereto, or\\r\\nshall engage in or give aid and comfort to any such existing rebellion or\\r\\ninsurrection.\" By fair construction persons within these sections are not\\r\\nto be punished without regular trials in duly constituted courts,\\r\\nunder the forms and all the substantial provisions of law and of the\\r\\nConstitution applicable to their several cases. To this I perceive\\r\\nno objection, especially as such persons would be within the general\\r\\npardoning power and also the special provision for pardon and amnesty\\r\\ncontained in this act.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also provided that the slaves of persons convicted under these\\r\\nsections shall be free. I think there is an unfortunate form of expression\\r\\nrather than a substantial objection in this. It is startling to say that\\r\\nCongress can free a slave within a State, and yet if it were said the\\r\\nownership of the slave had first been transferred to the nation and that\\r\\nCongress had then liberated him the difficulty would at once vanish. And\\r\\nthis is the real case. The traitor against the General Government forfeits\\r\\nhis slave at least as justly as he does any other property, and he\\r\\nforfeits both to the government against which be offends. The government,\\r\\nso far as there can be ownership, thus owns the forfeited slaves, and the\\r\\nquestion for Congress in regard to them is, \"Shall they be made free or\\r\\nbe sold to new masters?\" I perceive no objection to Congress deciding in\\r\\nadvance that they shall be free. To the high honor of Kentucky, as I am\\r\\ninformed, she is the owner of some slaves by escheat, and has sold none,\\r\\nbut liberated all. I hope the same is true of some other States. Indeed,\\r\\nI do not believe it will be physically possible for the General Government\\r\\nto return persons so circumstanced to actual slavery. I believe there\\r\\nwould be physical resistance to it which could neither be turned aside\\r\\nby argument nor driven away by force. In this view I have no objection to\\r\\nthis feature of the bill. Another matter involved in these two sections,\\r\\nand running through other parts of the act, will be noticed hereafter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI perceive no objection to the third or fourth sections.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far as I wish to notice the fifth and sixth sections, they may be\\r\\nconsidered together. That the enforcement of these sections would do no\\r\\ninjustice to the persons embraced within them, is clear. That those who\\r\\nmake a causeless war should be compelled to pay the cost of it, is too\\r\\nobviously just to be called in question. To give governmental protection\\r\\nto the property of persons who have abandoned it, and gone on a crusade to\\r\\noverthrow the same government, is absurd, if considered in the mere light\\r\\nof justice. The severest justice may not always be the best policy.\\r\\nThe principle of seizing and appropriating the property of the persons\\r\\nembraced within these sections is certainly not very objectionable, but a\\r\\njustly discriminating application of it would be very difficult and, to\\r\\na great extent, impossible. And would it not be wise to place a power of\\r\\nremission somewhere, so that these persons may know they have something to\\r\\nlose by persisting and something to gain by desisting?\\r\\n\\r\\n[A man without hope is a most dangerous man--he has nothing to lose!]\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not sure whether such power of remission is or is not in section\\r\\nthirteen. Without any special act of Congress, I think our military\\r\\ncommanders, when--in military phrase, \"they are within the enemy\\'s\\r\\ncountry,\" should, in an orderly manner, seize and use whatever of real or\\r\\npersonal property may be necessary or convenient for their commands; at\\r\\nthe same time preserving, in some way, the evidence of what they do.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I have said in regard to slaves, while commenting on the first and\\r\\nsecond sections, is applicable to the ninth, with the difference that no\\r\\nprovision is made in the whole act for determining whether a particular\\r\\nindividual slave does or does not fall within the classes defined in\\r\\nthat section. He is to be free upon certain conditions but whether\\r\\nthose conditions do or do not pertain to him no mode of ascertaining is\\r\\nprovided. This could be easily supplied.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the tenth section I make no objection. The oath therein required seems\\r\\nto be proper, and the remainder of the section is substantially identical\\r\\nwith a law already existing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eleventh section simply assumes to confer discretionary power upon\\r\\nthe executive. Without the law, I have no hesitation to go as far in the\\r\\ndirection indicated as I may at any time deem expedient. And I am ready\\r\\nto say now--I think it is proper for our military commanders to employ, as\\r\\nlaborers, as many persons of African descent as can be used to advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe twelfth and thirteenth sections are something better than\\r\\nunobjectionable; and the fourteenth is entirely proper, if all other parts\\r\\nof the act shall stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat to which I chiefly object pervades most parts of the act, but more\\r\\ndistinctly appears in the first, second, seventh, and eighth sections.\\r\\nIt is the sum of those provisions which results in the divesting of title\\r\\nforever.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the causes of treason and ingredients of treason, not amounting to\\r\\nthe full crime, it declares forfeiture extending beyond the lives of the\\r\\nguilty parties; whereas the Constitution of the United States declares\\r\\nthat \"no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture\\r\\nexcept during the life of the person attainted.\" True, there is to be\\r\\nno formal attainder in this case; still, I think the greater punishment\\r\\ncannot be constitutionally inflicted, in a different form, for the same\\r\\noffence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith great respect I am constrained to say I think this feature of the act\\r\\nis unconstitutional. It would not be difficult to modify it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI may remark that the provision of the Constitution, put in language\\r\\nborrowed from Great Britain, applies only in this country, as I\\r\\nunderstand, to real or landed estate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, this act in rem forfeits property for the ingredients of treason\\r\\nwithout a conviction of the supposed criminal, or a personal hearing given\\r\\nhim in any proceeding. That we may not touch property lying within our\\r\\nreach, because we cannot give personal notice to an owner who is absent\\r\\nendeavoring to destroy the government, is certainly not satisfactory.\\r\\nStill, the owner may not be thus engaged; and I think a reasonable time\\r\\nshould be provided for such parties to appear and have personal hearings.\\r\\nSimilar provisions are not uncommon in connection with proceedings in rem.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the reasons stated, I return the bill to the House in which it\\r\\noriginated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C., July 21, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is Monday.

LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nORDER IN REGARD TO BEHAVIOR OF ALIENS\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL\\'S OFFICE,\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, July 21, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following order has been received from the President of the United\\r\\nStates:\\r\\n\\r\\nRepresentations have been made to the President by the ministers of\\r\\nvarious foreign powers in amity with the United States that subjects of\\r\\nsuch powers have during the present insurrection been obliged or required\\r\\nby military authorities to take an oath of general or qualified allegiance\\r\\nto this government. It is the duty of all aliens residing in the United\\r\\nStates to submit to and obey the laws and respect the authority of\\r\\nthe government. For any proceeding or conduct inconsistent with this\\r\\nobligation and subversive of that authority they may rightfully be\\r\\nsubjected to military restraints when this may be necessary. But they\\r\\ncannot be required to take an oath of allegiance to this government,\\r\\nbecause it conflicts with the duty they owe to their own sovereigns. All\\r\\nsuch obligations heretofore taken are therefore remitted and annulled.\\r\\nMilitary commanders will abstain from imposing similar obligations in\\r\\nfuture, and will in lieu thereof adopt such other restraints of the\\r\\ncharacter indicated as they shall find necessary, convenient, and\\r\\neffectual for the public safety. It is further directed that whenever any\\r\\norder shall be made affecting the personal liberty of an alien reports of\\r\\nthe same and of the causes thereof shall be made to the War Department for\\r\\nthe consideration of the Department of State.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy order of the Secretary of War:\\r\\n\\r\\nL. THOMAS, Adjutant-General.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nORDER AUTHORIZING EMPLOYMENT OF \"CONTRABANDS.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, July 22, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrdered:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. That military commanders within the States of Virginia, South Carolina,\\r\\nGeorgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas in\\r\\nan orderly manner seize and use any property, real or personal, which may\\r\\nbe necessary or convenient for their several commands as supplies or for\\r\\nother military purposes; and that while property may be destroyed for\\r\\nproper military objects, none shall be destroyed in wantonness or malice.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. That military and naval commanders shall employ as laborers within\\r\\nand from said States so many persons of African descent as can be\\r\\nadvantageously used for military or naval purposes, giving them reasonable\\r\\nwages for their labor.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. That as to both property and persons of African descent accounts shall\\r\\nbe kept sufficiently accurate and in detail to show quantities and amounts\\r\\nand from whom both property and such persons shall have come, as a basis\\r\\nupon which compensation can be made in proper cases; and the several\\r\\ndepartments of this government shall attend to and perform their\\r\\nappropriate parts toward the execution of these orders.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy order of the President: EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWARNING TO REBEL SYMPATHIZERS\\r\\n\\r\\nPROCLAMATION, JULY 25, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\\r\\n\\r\\nA Proclamation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pursuance of the sixth section of the act of Congress entitled \"An act\\r\\nto suppress insurrection and to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and\\r\\nconfiscate property of rebels, and for other purposes,\" approved July\\r\\n17, 1862, and which act and the joint resolution explanatory thereof are\\r\\nherewith published, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do\\r\\nhereby proclaim to and warn all persons within the contemplation of\\r\\nsaid sixth section to cease participating in, aiding, countenancing, or\\r\\nabetting the existing rebellion or any rebellion against the Government of\\r\\nthe United States and to return to their proper allegiance to the United\\r\\nStates, on pain of the forfeitures and seizures as within and by said\\r\\nsixth section provided.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\\r\\nthe United States to be affixed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDone at the city of Washington, this twenty-fifth day of July, A.D. 1862,\\r\\nand of the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOLD MY HAND WHILST THE ENEMY STABS ME\\r\\n\\r\\nTO REVERDY JOHNSON.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Private.)\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 26, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. REVERDY JOHNSON.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 16th is received...........\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are ready to say I apply to friends what is due only to enemies. I\\r\\ndistrust the wisdom if not the sincerity of friends who would hold my\\r\\nhands while my enemies stab me. This appeal of professed friends has\\r\\nparalyzed me more in this struggle than any other one thing. You remember\\r\\ntelling me, the day after the Baltimore mob in April, 1861, that it would\\r\\ncrush all Union feeling in Maryland for me to attempt bringing troops over\\r\\nMaryland soil to Washington. I brought the troops notwithstanding, and\\r\\nyet there was Union feeling enough left to elect a Legislature the\\r\\nnext autumn, which in turn elected a very excellent Union United States\\r\\nsenator! I am a patient man--always willing to forgive on the Christian\\r\\nterms of repentance, and also to give ample time for repentance. Still,\\r\\nI must save this government, if possible. What I cannot do, of course, I\\r\\nwill not do; but it may as well be understood, once for all, that I shall\\r\\nnot surrender this game leaving any available card unplayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO CUTHBERT BULLITT.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Private.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, D. C., July 28, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCUTHBERT BULLITT, Esq., New Orleans, Louisiana.\\r\\n\\r\\nSIR:--The copy of a letter addressed to yourself by Mr. Thomas J. Durant\\r\\nhas been shown to me. The writer appears to be an able, a dispassionate,\\r\\nand an entirely sincere man. The first part of the letter is devoted to\\r\\nan effort to show that the secession ordinance of Louisiana was adopted\\r\\nagainst the will of a majority of the people. This is probably true,\\r\\nand in that fact may be found some instruction. Why did they allow the\\r\\nordinance to go into effect? Why did they not assert themselves? Why stand\\r\\npassive and allow themselves to be trodden down by minority? Why did they\\r\\nnot hold popular meetings and have a convention of their own to express\\r\\nand enforce the true sentiment of the State? If preorganization was\\r\\nagainst them then, why not do this now that the United States army is\\r\\npresent to protect them? The paralysis--the dead palsy--of the government\\r\\nin this whole struggle is that this class of men will do nothing for the\\r\\ngovernment, nothing for themselves, except demanding that the government\\r\\nshall not strike its open enemies, lest they be struck by accident!\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Durant complains that in various ways the relation of master and slave\\r\\nis disturbed by the presence of our army, and he considers it particularly\\r\\nvexatious that this, in part, is done under cover of an act of Congress,\\r\\nwhile constitutional guaranties are suspended on the plea of military\\r\\nnecessity. The truth is, that what is done and omitted about slaves\\r\\nis done and omitted on the same military necessity. It is a military\\r\\nnecessity to have men and money; and we can get neither in sufficient\\r\\nnumbers or amounts if we keep from or drive from our lines slaves coming\\r\\nto them. Mr. Durant cannot be ignorant of the pressure in this direction,\\r\\nnor of my efforts to hold it within bounds till he and such as he shall\\r\\nhave time to help themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not posted to speak understandingly on all the police regulations\\r\\nof which Mr. Durant complains. If experience shows any one of them to be\\r\\nwrong, let them be set right. I think I can perceive in the freedom\\r\\nof trade which Mr. Durant urges that he would relieve both friends and\\r\\nenemies from the pressure of the blockade. By this he would serve the\\r\\nenemy more effectively than the enemy is able to serve himself. I do not\\r\\nsay or believe that to serve the enemy is the purpose, of Mr. Durant,\\r\\nor that he is conscious of any purpose other than national and patriotic\\r\\nones. Still, if there were a class of men who, having no choice of sides\\r\\nin the contest, were anxious only to have quiet and comfort for themselves\\r\\nwhile it rages, and to fall in with the victorious side at the end of it\\r\\nwithout loss to themselves, their advice as to the mode of conducting\\r\\nthe contest would be precisely such as his is. He speaks of no\\r\\nduty--apparently thinks of none--resting upon Union men. He even thinks it\\r\\ninjurious to the Union cause that they should be restrained in trade and\\r\\npassage without taking sides. They are to touch neither a sail nor a pump,\\r\\nbut to be merely passengers--deadheads at that--to be carried snug and dry\\r\\nthroughout the storm, and safely landed right side up. Nay, more: even\\r\\na mutineer is to go untouched, lest these sacred passengers receive an\\r\\naccidental wound. Of course the rebellion will never be suppressed in\\r\\nLouisiana if the professed Union men there will neither help to do it nor\\r\\npermit the government to do it without their help. Now, I think the true\\r\\nremedy is very different from what is suggested by Mr. Durant. It does not\\r\\nlie in rounding the rough angles of the war, but in removing the necessity\\r\\nfor the war. The people of Louisiana who wish protection to person and\\r\\nproperty have but to reach forth their hands and take it. Let them in good\\r\\nfaith reinaugurate the national authority, and set up a State government\\r\\nconforming thereto under the Constitution. They know how to do it and can\\r\\nhave the protection of the army while doing it. The army will be withdrawn\\r\\nso soon as such State government can dispense with its presence; and the\\r\\npeople of the State can then, upon the old constitutional terms, govern\\r\\nthemselves to their own liking. This is very simple and easy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they will not do this--if they prefer to hazard all for the sake\\r\\nof destroying the government--it is for them to consider whether it is\\r\\nprobable I will surrender the government to save them from losing all. If\\r\\nthey decline what I suggest, you scarcely need to ask what I will do. What\\r\\nwould you do in my position? Would you drop the war where it is? Or would\\r\\nyou prosecute it in future with elder-stalk squirts charged with rose\\r\\nwater? Would you deal lighter blows rather than heavier ones? Would you\\r\\ngive up the contest, leaving any available means unapplied? I am in no\\r\\nboastful mood. I shall not do more than I can, and I shall do all I can,\\r\\nto save the government, which is my sworn duty as well as my personal\\r\\ninclination. I shall do nothing in malice. What I deal with is too vast\\r\\nfor malicious dealing.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO LOYAL GOVERNORS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.,\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 28, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nGOVERNORS OF ALL LOYAL STATES:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be of great service here for us to know, as fully as you can\\r\\ntell, what progress is made and making in recruiting for old regiments\\r\\nin your State. Also about what day the first regiments can move with you,\\r\\nwhat the second, what the third, and so on. This information is important\\r\\nto us in making calculations. Please give it as promptly and accurately as\\r\\nyou call.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBROKEN EGGS CANNOT BE MENDED\\r\\n\\r\\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER TO AUGUST BELMONT.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 31, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nBroken eggs cannot be mended; but Louisiana has nothing to do now but to\\r\\ntake her place in the Union as it was, barring the already broken eggs.\\r\\nThe sooner she does so, the smaller will be the amount of that which will\\r\\nbe past mending. This government cannot much longer play a game in\\r\\nwhich it stakes all, and its enemies stake nothing. Those enemies must\\r\\nunderstand that they cannot experiment for ten years trying to destroy the\\r\\ngovernment, and if they fail, still come back into the Union unhurt. If\\r\\nthey expect in any contingency to ever have the Union as it was, I join\\r\\nwith the writer in saying, \"Now is the time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much better it would have been for the writer to have gone at this,\\r\\nunder the protection of the army at New Orleans, than to have sat down in\\r\\na closet writing complaining letters northward!\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO COUNT GASPARIN.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 4, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO COUNT A. DE GASPARIN.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR SIR--Your very acceptable letter, dated Orbe, Canton de Vaud,\\r\\nSwitzerland, 18th of July, 1862, is received. The moral effect was the\\r\\nworst of the affair before Richmond, and that has run its course downward.\\r\\nWe are now at a stand, and shall soon be rising again, as we hope. I\\r\\nbelieve it is true that, in men and material, the enemy suffered more than\\r\\nwe in that series of conflicts, while it is certain that he is less able\\r\\nto bear it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith us every soldier is a man of character, and must be treated with\\r\\nmore consideration than is customary in Europe. Hence our great army, for\\r\\nslighter causes than could have prevailed there, has dwindled rapidly,\\r\\nbringing the necessity for a new call earlier than was anticipated. We\\r\\nshall easily obtain the new levy, however. Be not alarmed if you shall\\r\\nlearn that we shall have resorted to a draft for part of this. It seems\\r\\nstrange even to me, but it is true, that the government is now pressed\\r\\nto this course by a popular demand. Thousands who wish not to personally\\r\\nenter the service are nevertheless anxious to pay and send substitutes,\\r\\nprovided they can have assurance that unwilling persons, similarly\\r\\nsituated, will be compelled to do likewise. Besides this, volunteers\\r\\nmostly choose to enter newly forming regiments, while drafted men can be\\r\\nsent to fill up the old ones, wherein man for man they are quite doubly as\\r\\nvaluable.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou ask, \"Why is it that the North with her great armies so often is found\\r\\nwith inferiority of numbers face to face with the armies of the South?\"\\r\\nWhile I painfully know the fact, a military man, which I am not, would\\r\\nbetter answer the question. The fact I know has not been overlooked, and\\r\\nI suppose the cause of its continuance lies mainly in the other facts\\r\\nthat the enemy holds the interior and we the exterior lines, and that\\r\\nwe operate where the people convey information to the enemy, while he\\r\\noperates where they convey none to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have received the volume and letter which you did me the honor of\\r\\naddressing to me, and for which please accept my sincere thanks. You are\\r\\nmuch admired in America for the ability of your writings, and much\\r\\nloved for your generosity to us and your devotion to liberal principles\\r\\ngenerally.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are quite right as to the importance to us, for its bearing upon\\r\\nEurope, that we should achieve military successes, and the same is true\\r\\nfor us at home as well as abroad. Yet it seems unreasonable that a series\\r\\nof successes, extending through half a year, and clearing more than\\r\\n100,000 square miles of country, should help us so little, while a single\\r\\nhalf-defeat should hurt us so much. But let us be patient.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very happy to know that my course has not conflicted with your\\r\\njudgment of propriety and policy I can only say that I have acted upon my\\r\\nbest convictions, without selfishness or malice, and that by the help of\\r\\nGod I shall continue to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease be assured of my highest respect and esteem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSPEECH AT A WAR MEETING, WASHINGTON, AUGUST 6, 1862\\r\\n\\r\\nFELLOW CITIZENS: I believe there is no precedent for my appearing before\\r\\nyou on this occasion, but it is also true that there is no precedent for\\r\\nyour being here yourselves, and I offer in justification of myself and\\r\\nof you that, upon examination, I have found nothing in the Constitution\\r\\nagainst it. I, however, have an impression that; there are younger\\r\\ngentlemen who will entertain you better and better address your\\r\\nunderstanding than I will or could, and therefore I propose but to detain\\r\\nyou a moment longer. I am very little inclined on any occasion to say\\r\\nanything unless I hope to produce some good by it. The only thing I think\\r\\nof just now not likely to be better said by some one else is a matter in\\r\\nwhich we have heard some other persons blamed for what I did myself There\\r\\nhas been a very widespread attempt to have a quarrel between General\\r\\nMcClellan and the Secretary of War Now, I occupy a position that enables\\r\\nme to believe that these two gentlemen are not nearly so deep in the\\r\\nquarrel as some presuming to be their friends. General McClellan\\'s\\r\\nattitude is such that in the very selfishness of his nature he cannot but\\r\\nwish to be successful--and I hope he will--and the Secretary of War is\\r\\nprecisely in the same situation. If the military commanders in the field\\r\\ncannot be successful, not only the Secretary of War, but myself, for the\\r\\ntime being the master of both, cannot but be failures. I know General\\r\\nMcClellan wishes to be successful, and I know he does not wish it any more\\r\\nthan the Secretary of War for him, and both of them together no more\\r\\nthan I wish it. Sometimes we have a dispute about how many men General\\r\\nMcClellan has had, and those who would disparage him say he has had a very\\r\\nlarge number, and those who would disparage the Secretary of War insist\\r\\nthat General McClellan has had a very small number. The basis for this is,\\r\\nthere is always a wide difference, and on this occasion perhaps a wider\\r\\none, between the grand total on McClellan\\'s rolls and the men actually\\r\\nfit for duty; and those who would disparage him talk of the grand total on\\r\\npaper, and those who would disparage the Secretary of War talk of those\\r\\nat present fit for duty. General McClellan has sometimes asked for things\\r\\nthat the Secretary of War did not give him. General McClellan is not to\\r\\nblame for asking for what he wanted and needed, and the Secretary of War\\r\\nis not to blame for not giving when he had none to give. And I say here,\\r\\nso far as I know, the Secretary of War has withheld no one thing at any\\r\\ntime in my power to give him. I have no accusation against him. I believe\\r\\nhe is a brave and able man, and I stand here, as justice requires me to\\r\\ndo, to take upon myself what has been charged on the Secretary of War as\\r\\nwithholding from him. I have talked longer than I expected to do, and now\\r\\nI avail myself of my privilege of saying no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR ANDREW. August 12, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C.\\r\\n\\r\\nGOVERNOR ANDREW, Boston, Mass.:\\r\\n\\r\\nYour despatch saying \"I can\\'t get those regiments off because I can\\'t\\r\\nget quick work out of the V.

Please\\r\\nanswer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nADDRESS ON COLONIZATION TO A DEPUTATION OF COLORED MEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, Thursday, August 14, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis afternoon the President of the United States gave an audience to a\\r\\ncommittee of colored men at the White House. They were introduced by\\r\\nRev. J. Mitchell, Commissioner of Emigration, E. M. Thomas, the chairman,\\r\\nremarked that they were there by invitation to hear what the Executive had\\r\\nto say to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving all been seated, the President, after a few preliminary\\r\\nobservations, informed them that a sum of money had been appropriated by\\r\\nCongress, and placed at his disposition, for the purpose of aiding the\\r\\ncolonization, in some country, of the people, or a portion of them, of\\r\\nAfrican descent, thereby making it his duty, as it had for a long time\\r\\nbeen his inclination, to favor that cause. And why, he asked, should the\\r\\npeople of your race be colonized, and where? Why should they leave this\\r\\ncountry? This is, perhaps, the first question for proper consideration.\\r\\nYou and we are different races. We have between us a broader difference\\r\\nthan exists between almost any other two races. Whether it is right\\r\\nor wrong I need not discuss; but this physical difference is a great\\r\\ndisadvantage to us both, as I think. Your race suffer very greatly, many\\r\\nof them, by living among us, while ours suffer from your presence. In a\\r\\nword, we suffer on each side. If this is admitted, it affords a reason, at\\r\\nleast, why we should be separated. You here are free men, I suppose.\\r\\n\\r\\n[A voice--\"Yes, sir!\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps you have long been free, or all your lives. Your race are\\r\\nsuffering, in my judgment, the greatest wrong inflicted on any people.\\r\\nBut even when you cease to be slaves, you are yet far removed from being\\r\\nplaced on an equality with the white race. You are cut off from many of\\r\\nthe advantages which the other race enjoys. The aspiration of men is to\\r\\nenjoy equality with the best when free, but on this broad continent not\\r\\na single man of your race is made the equal of a single man of ours. Go\\r\\nwhere you are treated the best, and the ban is still upon you. I do not\\r\\npropose to discuss this, but to present it as a fact, with which we have\\r\\nto deal. I cannot alter it if I would. It is a fact about which we all\\r\\nthink and feel alike, I and you. We look to our condition. Owing to the\\r\\nexistence of the two races on this continent, I need not recount to you\\r\\nthe effects upon white men, growing out of the institution of slavery.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe in its general evil effects on the white race. See our present\\r\\ncondition--the country engaged in war--white men cutting one another\\'s\\r\\nthroats--none knowing how far it will extend--and then consider what we\\r\\nknow to be the truth: But for your race among us there could not be war,\\r\\nalthough many men engaged on either side do not care for you one way or\\r\\nthe other. Nevertheless I repeat, without the institution of slavery and\\r\\nthe colored race as a basis, the war could not have an existence. It is\\r\\nbetter for us both, therefore, to be separated. I know that there are free\\r\\nmen among you, who, even if they could better their condition, are not as\\r\\nmuch inclined to go out of the country as those who, being slaves, could\\r\\nobtain their freedom on this condition. I suppose one of the principal\\r\\ndifficulties in the way of colonization is that the free colored man\\r\\ncannot see that his comfort would be advanced by it. You may believe\\r\\nthat you can live in WASHINGTON, or elsewhere in the United States, the\\r\\nremainder of your life, as easily, perhaps more so, than you can in any\\r\\nforeign Country; and hence you may come to the conclusion that you have\\r\\nnothing to do with the idea of going to a foreign country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is (I speak in no unkind sense) an extremely selfish view of the\\r\\ncase. You ought to do something to help those who are not so fortunate as\\r\\nyourselves. There is an unwillingness on the part of our people, harsh\\r\\nas it may be, for you free colored people to remain with us. Now, if you\\r\\ncould give a start to the white people, you would open a wide door for\\r\\nmany to be made free. If we deal with those who are not free at the\\r\\nbeginning, and whose intellects are clouded by slavery, we have very poor\\r\\nmaterial to start with. If intelligent colored men, such as are before me,\\r\\nwould move in this matter, much might be accomplished.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is exceedingly important that we have men at the beginning capable\\r\\nof thinking as white men, and not those who have been systematically\\r\\noppressed. There is much to encourage you. For the sake of your race you\\r\\nshould sacrifice something of your present comfort for the purpose of\\r\\nbeing as grand in that respect as the white people. It is a cheering\\r\\nthought throughout life that something can be done to ameliorate the\\r\\ncondition of those who have been subject to the hard usages of the world.\\r\\nIt is difficult to make a man miserable while he feels he is worthy of\\r\\nhimself and claims kindred to the great God who made him. In the American\\r\\nRevolutionary war sacrifices were made by men engaged in it, but they were\\r\\ncheered by the future. General WASHINGTON himself endured greater physical\\r\\nhardships than if he had remained a British subject, yet he was a happy\\r\\nman because he had engaged in benefiting his race, in doing something for\\r\\nthe children of his neighbors, having none of his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colony of Liberia has been in existence a long time. In a certain\\r\\nsense it is a success. The old President of Liberia, Roberts, has just\\r\\nbeen with me--the first time I ever saw him. He says they have within the\\r\\nbounds of that colony between three and four hundred thousand people, or\\r\\nmore than in some of our old States, such as Rhode Island or Delaware,\\r\\nor in some of our newer States, and less than in some of our larger ones.\\r\\nThey are not all American colonists or their descendants. Something less\\r\\nthan 12,000 have been sent thither from this country. Many of the original\\r\\nsettlers have died; yet, like people else-where, their offspring outnumber\\r\\nthose deceased. The question is, if the colored people are persuaded to go\\r\\nanywhere, why not there?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne reason for unwillingness to do so is that some of you would rather\\r\\nremain within reach of the country of your nativity. I do not know how\\r\\nmuch attachment you may have toward our race. It does not strike me that\\r\\nyou have the greatest reason to love them. But still you are attached to\\r\\nthem, at all events.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place I am thinking about for a colony is in Central America. It is\\r\\nnearer to us than Liberia not much more than one fourth as far as Liberia,\\r\\nand within seven days\\' run by steamers. Unlike Liberia, it is a great line\\r\\nof travel--it is a highway. The country is a very excellent one for any\\r\\npeople, and with great natural resources and advantages, and especially\\r\\nbecause of the similarity of climate with your native soil, thus being\\r\\nsuited to your physical condition. The particular place I have in view is\\r\\nto be a great highway from the Atlantic or Caribbean Sea to the Pacific\\r\\nOcean, and this particular place has all the advantages for a colony. On\\r\\nboth sides there are harbors--among the finest in the world. Again, there\\r\\nis evidence of very rich coal-mines. A certain amount of coal is valuable\\r\\nin any country. Why I attach so much importance to coal is, it will afford\\r\\nan opportunity to the inhabitants for immediate employment till they get\\r\\nready to settle permanently in their homes. If you take colonists where\\r\\nthere is no good landing, there is a bad show; and so where there is\\r\\nnothing to cultivate and of which to make a farm. But if something is\\r\\nstarted so that you can get your daily bread as soon as reach you there,\\r\\nit is a great advantage. Coal land is the best thing I know of with which\\r\\nto commence an enterprise. To return--you have been talked to upon this\\r\\nsubject, and told that a speculation is intended by gentlemen who have an\\r\\ninterest in the country, including the coal-mines. We have been mistaken\\r\\nall our lives if we do not know whites, as well as blacks, look to their\\r\\nself-interest. Unless among those deficient of intellect, everybody\\r\\nyou trade with makes something. You meet with these things here and\\r\\neverywhere. If such persons have what will be an advantage to them,\\r\\nthe question is whether it cannot be made of advantage to you. You are\\r\\nintelligent, and know that success does not so much depend on external\\r\\nhelp as on self-reliance. Much, therefore, depends upon yourselves. As to\\r\\nthe coal-mines, I think I see the means available for your self-reliance.\\r\\nI shall, if I get a sufficient number of you engaged, have provision made\\r\\nthat you shall not be wronged. If you will engage in the enterprise,\\r\\nI will spend some of the money intrusted to me. I am not sure you will\\r\\nsucceed. The government may lose the money; but we cannot succeed unless\\r\\nwe try, and we think with care we can succeed. The political affairs in\\r\\nCentral America are not in quite as satisfactory a condition as I wish.\\r\\nThere are contending factions in that quarter, but it is true all the\\r\\nfactions are agreed alike on the subject of colonization, and want it, and\\r\\nare more generous than we are here.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo your colored race they have no objection I would endeavor to have\\r\\nyou made the equals, and have the best assurance that you should be the\\r\\nequals, of the best.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe practical thing I want to ascertain is whether I can get a number of\\r\\nable-bodied men, with their wives and children, who are willing to go when\\r\\nI present evidence of encouragement and protection. Could I get a hundred\\r\\ntolerably intelligent men, with their wives and children, and able to\\r\\n\"cut their own fodder,\" so to speak? Can I have fifty? If I could find\\r\\ntwenty-five able-bodied men, with a mixture of women and children--good\\r\\nthings in the family relation, I think,--I could make a successful\\r\\ncommencement. I want you to let me know whether this can be done or not.\\r\\nThis is the practical part of my wish to see you. These are subjects of\\r\\nvery great importance, worthy of a month\\'s study, instead of a speech\\r\\ndelivered in an hour. I ask you, then, to consider seriously, not\\r\\npertaining to yourselves merely, nor for your race and ours for the\\r\\npresent time, but as one of the things, if successfully managed, the good\\r\\nof mankind--not confined to the present generation, but as\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"From age to age descends the lay\\r\\n   To millions yet to be,\\r\\n   Till far its echoes roll away\\r\\n   Into eternity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above is merely given as the substance of the President\\'s remarks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chairman of the delegation briefly replied that they would hold a\\r\\nconsultation, and in a short time give an answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President said: Take your full time-no hurry at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe delegation then withdrew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO OFFICER AT CAMP CHASE, OHIO.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.

Owing to\\r\\nher early and strong friendship for you, I would gladly oblige you, but I\\r\\ncannot absolutely do it. If General Boyle and Hon.

WATSON, Williamsburg, Va.:\\r\\n\\r\\nYour telegram in regard to the lunatic asylum has been received. It\\r\\nis certainly a case of difficulty, but if you cannot remain, I cannot\\r\\nconceive who under my authority can. Remain as long as you safely can and\\r\\nprovide as well as you can for the poor inmates of the institution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO HORACE GREELEY.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 22, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. HORACE GREELEY.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR SIR:--I have just read yours of the 19th, addressed to myself through\\r\\nthe New York Tribune. If there be in it any statements or assumptions of\\r\\nfact which I may know to be erroneous, I do not now and here controvert\\r\\nthem. If there be in it any inferences which I may believe to be falsely\\r\\ndrawn, I do not now and here argue against them. If there be perceptible\\r\\nin it an impatient and dictatorial tone, I waive it in deference to an old\\r\\nfriend, whose heart I have always supposed to be right.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the policy I \"seem to be pursuing,\" as you say, I have not meant to\\r\\nleave any one in doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the\\r\\nConstitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored, the\\r\\nnearer the Union will be, \"the Union as it was.\" If there be those who\\r\\nwould not save the Union unless they could at the same time save slavery,\\r\\nI do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union\\r\\nunless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with\\r\\nthem. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is\\r\\nnot either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without\\r\\nfreeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing\\r\\nall the slaves, I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some and\\r\\nleaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery and\\r\\nthe colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save this Union; and\\r\\nwhat I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save\\r\\nthe Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts\\r\\nthe cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will\\r\\nhelp the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and\\r\\nI shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views. I\\r\\nhave here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty, and\\r\\nI intend no modification of my oft expressed personal wish that all men,\\r\\neverywhere, could be free.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR YATES.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., August 13.1862. 8 A.M.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. R. YATES, Springfield, Ill.:\\r\\n\\r\\nI am pained to hear that you reject the service of an officer we sent\\r\\nto assist in organizing and getting off troops. Pennsylvania and Indiana\\r\\naccepted such officers kindly, and they now have more than twice as many\\r\\nnew troops in the field as all the other States together. If Illinois\\r\\nhad got forward as many troops as Indiana, Cumberland Gap would soon be\\r\\nrelieved from its present peril. Please do not ruin us on punctilio.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

CURTIN, Governor of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg,\\r\\nPennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\nSIR:--The application made to me by your adjutant general for authority\\r\\nto call out the militia of the State of Pennsylvania has received careful\\r\\nconsideration. It is my anxious desire to afford, as far as possible,\\r\\nthe means and power of the Federal Government to protect the State\\r\\nof Pennsylvania from invasion by the rebel forces; and since, in your\\r\\njudgment, the militia of the State are required, and have been called upon\\r\\nby you, to organize for home defense and protection, I sanction the call\\r\\nthat you have made, and will receive them into the service and pay of\\r\\nthe United States to the extent they can be armed, equipped, and usefully\\r\\nemployed. The arms and equipments now belonging to the General Government\\r\\nwill be needed for the troops called out for the national armies, so that\\r\\narms can only be furnished for the quota of militia furnished by the draft\\r\\nof nine months\\' men, heretofore ordered. But as arms may be supplied by\\r\\nthe militia under your call, these, with the 30,000 in your arsenal, will\\r\\nprobably be sufficient for the purpose contemplated by your call. You will\\r\\nbe authorized to provide such equipments as may be required, according\\r\\nto the regulations of the United States service, which, upon being turned\\r\\nover to the United States Quartermaster\\'s Department, will be paid for\\r\\nat regulation prices, or the rates allowed by the department for such\\r\\narticles. Railroad transportation will also be paid for, as in other\\r\\ncases. Such general officers will be supplied as the exigencies of the\\r\\nservice will permit.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

If Porter, Heintzelman, and Sigel were sent you, it\\r\\nwould sweep everything from the other side of the river, because the new\\r\\ntroops have been distributed among them, as I understand.

Please consider we have not to exceed 80,000\\r\\ndisciplined troops, properly so called, this side of the mountains; and\\r\\nmost of them, with many of the new regiments, are now close in the rear\\r\\nof the enemy supposed to be invading Pennsylvania. Start half of them to\\r\\nHarrisburg, and the enemy will turn upon and beat the remaining half, and\\r\\nthen reach Harrisburg before the part going there, and beat it too when\\r\\nit comes.

Where is the enemy which you dread\\r\\nin Louisville? How near to you? What is General Gilbert\\'s opinion? With\\r\\nall possible respect for you, I must think General Wright\\'s military\\r\\nopinion is the better. He is as much responsible for Louisville as\\r\\nfor Cincinnati. General Halleck telegraphed him on this very subject\\r\\nyesterday, and I telegraph him now; but for us here to control him\\r\\nthere on the ground would be a babel of confusion which would be utterly\\r\\nruinous.

Please do not be offended when I assure\\r\\nyou that in my confident belief Philadelphia is in no danger. Governor\\r\\nCurtin has just telegraphed me: \"I have advices that Jackson is crossing\\r\\nthe Potomac at Williamsport, and probably the whole rebel army will be\\r\\ndrawn from Maryland.\" At all events, Philadelphia is more than 150 miles\\r\\nfrom Hagerstown, and could not be reached by the rebel army in ten days,\\r\\nif no hindrance was interposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

McCLELLAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON CITY, D.C., September 12, 1862. 5.45 PM\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor Curtin telegraphs me:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have advices that Jackson is crossing the Potomac at Williamsport, and\\r\\nprobably the whole rebel army will be down from Maryland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nReceiving nothing from Harper\\'s Ferry or Martinsburg to-day, and positive\\r\\ninformation from Wheeling that the line is cut, corroborates the idea that\\r\\nthe enemy is crossing the Potomac. Please do not let him get off without\\r\\nbeing hurt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n    [But he did! D.W.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nREPLY TO REQUEST THE PRESIDENT ISSUE A PROCLAMATION OF EMANCIPATION.\\r\\n\\r\\nA COMMITTEE FROM THE RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS OF CHICAGO,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 13,1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject presented in the memorial is one upon which I have thought\\r\\nmuch for weeks past, and I may even say for months. I am approached with\\r\\nthe most opposite opinions and advice, and that by religious men, who are\\r\\nequally certain that they represent the Divine will. I am sure that either\\r\\nthe one or the other class is mistaken in that belief, and perhaps in some\\r\\nrespects both. I hope it will not be irreverent for me to say that if\\r\\nit is probable that God would reveal his will to others, on a point so\\r\\nconnected with my duty, it might be supposed he would reveal it directly\\r\\nto me; for, unless I am more deceived in myself than I often am, it is my\\r\\nearnest desire to know the will of Providence in this matter. And if I\\r\\ncan learn what it is I will do it! These are not, however, the days of\\r\\nmiracles, and I suppose it will be granted that I am not to expect a\\r\\ndirect revelation. I must study the plain physical facts of the case,\\r\\nascertain what is possible, and learn what appears to be wise and right.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject is difficult, and good men do not agree. For instance, the\\r\\nother day, four gentlemen of standing and intelligence from New York\\r\\ncalled as a delegation on business connected with the war; but\\r\\nbefore leaving two of them earnestly besought me to proclaim general\\r\\nemancipation, upon which the other two at once attacked them. You\\r\\nknow also that the last session of Congress had a decided majority of\\r\\nantislavery men, yet they could not unite on this policy. And the same is\\r\\ntrue of the religious people. Why, the rebel soldiers are praying with a\\r\\ngreat deal more earnestness, I fear, than our own troops, and expecting\\r\\nGod to favor their side: for one of our soldiers who had been taken\\r\\nprisoner told Senator Wilson a few days since that he met nothing so\\r\\ndiscouraging as the evident sincerity of those he was among in their\\r\\nprayers. But we will talk over the merits of the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do, especially\\r\\nas we are now situated? I do not want to issue a document that the whole\\r\\nworld will see must necessarily be inoperative, like the Pope\\'s bull\\r\\nagainst the comet! Would my word free the slaves, when I cannot even\\r\\nenforce the Constitution in the rebel States? Is there a single court, or\\r\\nmagistrate or individual that would be influenced by it there? And what\\r\\nreason is there to think it would have any greater effect upon the\\r\\nslaves than the late law of Congress, which I approved, and which offers\\r\\nprotection and freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who come within our\\r\\nlines? Yet I cannot learn that that law has caused a single slave to come\\r\\nover to us. And suppose they could be induced by a proclamation of freedom\\r\\nfrom me to throw themselves upon us, what should we do with them? How can\\r\\nwe feed and care for such a multitude? General Butler wrote me a few days\\r\\nsince that he was issuing more rations to the slaves who have rushed to\\r\\nhim than to all the white troops under his command. They eat, and that is\\r\\nall; though it is true General Butler is feeding the whites also by the\\r\\nthousand; for it nearly amounts to a famine there. If, now, the pressure\\r\\nof the war should call off our forces from New Orleans to defend some\\r\\nother point, what is to prevent the masters from reducing the blacks\\r\\nto slavery again? for I am told that whenever the rebels take any black\\r\\nprisoners, free or slave, they immediately auction them off. They did so\\r\\nwith those they took from a boat that was aground in the Tennessee River\\r\\na few days ago. And then I am very ungenerously attacked for it! For\\r\\ninstance, when, after the late battles at and near Bull Run, an expedition\\r\\nwent out from Washington under a flag of truce to bury the dead and bring\\r\\nin the wounded, and the rebels seized the blacks who went along to help,\\r\\nand sent them into slavery, Horace Greeley said in his paper that the\\r\\ngovernment would probably do nothing about it. What could I do?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, then, tell me, if you please, what possible result of good would\\r\\nfollow the issuing of such a proclamation as you desire? Understand, I\\r\\nraise no objections against it on legal or constitutional grounds; for, as\\r\\ncommander-in-chief of the army and navy, in time of war I suppose I have\\r\\na right to take any measure which may best subdue the enemy; nor do I\\r\\nurge objections of a moral nature, in view of possible consequences of\\r\\ninsurrection and massacre at the South. I view this matter as a practical\\r\\nwar measure, to be decided on according to the advantages or disadvantages\\r\\nit may offer to the suppression of the rebellion.\\r\\n\\r\\nI admit that slavery is the root of the rebellion, or at least its sine\\r\\nqua non. The ambition of politicians may have instigated them to act, but\\r\\nthey would have been impotent without slavery as their instrument. I will\\r\\nalso concede that emancipation would help us in Europe, and convince them\\r\\nthat we are incited by something more than ambition. I grant, further,\\r\\nthat it would help somewhat at the North, though not so much, I fear, as\\r\\nyou and those you represent imagine. Still, some additional strength would\\r\\nbe added in that way to the war, and then, unquestionably, it would weaken\\r\\nthe rebels by drawing off their laborers, which is of great importance;\\r\\nbut I am not so sure we could do much with the blacks. If we were to arm\\r\\nthem, I fear that in a few weeks the arms would be in the hands of the\\r\\nrebels; and, indeed, thus far we have not had arms enough to equip our\\r\\nwhite troops. I will mention another thing, though it meet only your scorn\\r\\nand contempt. There are fifty thousand bayonets in the Union armies from\\r\\nthe border slave States. It would be a serious matter if, in consequence\\r\\nof a proclamation such as you desire, they should go over to the rebels. I\\r\\ndo not think they all would--not so many, indeed, as a year ago, or as\\r\\nsix months ago--not so many to-day as yesterday. Every day increases their\\r\\nUnion feeling. They are also getting their pride enlisted, and want to\\r\\nbeat the rebels. Let me say one thing more: I think you should admit that\\r\\nwe already have an important principle to rally and unite the people, in\\r\\nthe fact that constitutional government is at stake. This is a fundamental\\r\\nidea going down about as deep as anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not misunderstand me because I have mentioned these objections. They\\r\\nindicate the difficulties that have thus far prevented my action in some\\r\\nsuch way as you desire. I have not decided against a proclamation of\\r\\nliberty to the slaves, but hold the matter under advisement; and I can\\r\\nassure you that the subject is on my mind, by day and night, more than any\\r\\nother. Whatever shall appear to be God\\'s will, I will do. I trust that\\r\\nin the freedom with which I have canvassed your views I have not in any\\r\\nrespect injured your feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. G.

That during the existing insurrection, and as a necessary measure\\r\\nfor suppressing the same, all rebels and insurgents, their aiders and\\r\\nabettors within the United States, and all persons discouraging volunteer\\r\\nenlistments, resisting militia drafts, or guilty of any disloyal practice\\r\\naffording aid and comfort to rebels against the authority of the\\r\\nUnited States, shall be subject to martial law, and liable to trial and\\r\\npunishment by courts-martial or military commissions.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond.

SEWARD, Secretary of State.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nREPLY TO SERENADE, SEPTEMBER 24, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nI appear before you to do little more than acknowledge the courtesy you\\r\\npay me, and to thank you for it. I have not been distinctly informed\\r\\nwhy it is that on this occasion you appear to do me this honor, though I\\r\\nsuppose it is because of the proclamation. What I did, I did after a\\r\\nvery full deliberation, and under a very heavy and solemn sense of\\r\\nresponsibility. I can only trust in God I have made no mistake. I shall\\r\\nmake no attempt on this occasion to sustain what I have done or said by\\r\\nany comment. It is now for the country and the world to pass judgment and,\\r\\nmaybe, take action upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will say no more upon this subject. In my position I am environed with\\r\\ndifficulties. Yet they are scarcely so great as the difficulties of those\\r\\nwho upon the battle-field are endeavoring to purchase with their blood and\\r\\ntheir lives the future happiness and prosperity of this country. Let us\\r\\nnever forget them. On the fourteenth and seventeenth days of this present\\r\\nmonth there have been battles bravely, skillfully, and successfully\\r\\nfought. We do not yet know the particulars. Let us be sure that, in giving\\r\\npraise to certain individuals, we do no injustice to others. I only ask\\r\\nyou, at the conclusion of these few remarks, to give three hearty cheers\\r\\nfor all good and brave officers and men who fought those successful\\r\\nbattles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRECORD EXPLAINING THE DISMISSAL OF MAJOR JOHN J. KEY\\r\\n\\r\\nFROM THE MILITARY SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 26, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR JOHN J. KEY:\\r\\n\\r\\nI am informed that, in answer to the question, \"Why was not the rebel army\\r\\nbagged immediately after the battle near Sharpsburg?\" propounded to you\\r\\nby Major Levi C. Turner, Judge Advocate, etc., you said: \"That is not the\\r\\ngame. The object is, that neither army shall get much advantage of the\\r\\nother; that both shall be kept in the field till they are exhausted, when\\r\\nwe will make a compromise and save slavery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall be very happy if you will, within twenty-four hours from the\\r\\nreceipt of this, prove to me by Major Turner that you did not, either\\r\\nliterally or in substance, make the answer stated.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Above delivered to Major Key at 10.25 a.m. September 27th.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt about 11 o\\'clock A.M., September 27, 1862, Major Key and Major Turner\\r\\nappeared before me. Major Turner says:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I remember it, the conversation was: \\'Why did we not bag them after\\r\\nthe battle of Sharpsburg?\\' Major Key\\'s reply was: \\'That was not the game;\\r\\nthat we should tire the rebels out and ourselves; that that was the\\r\\nonly way the Union could be preserved, we come together fraternally, and\\r\\nslavery be saved.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn cross-examination, Major Turner says he has frequently heard Major Key\\r\\nconverse in regard to the present troubles, and never heard him utter\\r\\na sentiment unfavorable to the maintenance of the Union. He has never\\r\\nuttered anything which he, Major T., would call disloyalty. The particular\\r\\nconversation detailed was a private one.\\r\\n\\r\\n           [Indorsement on the above.]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my view, it is wholly inadmissible for any gentleman holding a military\\r\\ncommission from the United States to utter such sentiments as Major Key is\\r\\nwithin proved to have done. Therefore, let Major John J. Key be forthwith\\r\\ndismissed from the military service of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Strictly private.)\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 28, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR: Your kind letter of the 25th is just received. It is known to\\r\\nsome that, while I hope something from the proclamation, my expectations\\r\\nare not as sanguine as are those of some friends. The time for its effect\\r\\nsouthward has not come; but northward the effect should be instantaneous.\\r\\nIt is six days old, and, while commendation in newspapers and by\\r\\ndistinguished individuals is all that a vain man could wish, the stocks\\r\\nhave declined, and troops come forward more slowly than ever. This, looked\\r\\nsoberly in the face, is not very satisfactory. We have fewer troops in\\r\\nthe field at the end of the six days than we had at the beginning--the\\r\\nattrition among the old outnumbering the addition by the new. The North\\r\\nresponds to the proclamation sufficiently in breath; but breath alone\\r\\nkills no rebels.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish I could write more cheerfully; nor do I thank you the less for the\\r\\nkindness of your letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL HALLECK.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCLELLAN\\'S HEADQUARTERS, October 3, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Stuart, of the rebel army, has sent in a few of our prisoners\\r\\nunder a flag of truce, paroled with terms to prevent their fighting the\\r\\nIndians, and evidently seeking to commit us to their right to parole\\r\\nprisoners in that way. My inclination is to send the prisoners back with\\r\\na definite notice that we will recognize no paroles given to our prisoners\\r\\nby the rebels as extending beyond a prohibition against fighting them,\\r\\nthough I wish your opinion upon it, based both upon the general law and\\r\\nour cartel. I wish to avoid violations of the law and bad faith. Answer as\\r\\nquickly as possible, as the thing, if done at all, should be done at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN, President\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nREMARKS TO THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC AT FREDERICK, MARYLAND,\\r\\n\\r\\nOCTOBER, 4, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am surrounded by soldiers and a little farther off by the citizens of\\r\\nthis good City of Frederick. Nevertheless I can only say, as I did five\\r\\nminutes ago, it is not proper for me to make speeches in my present\\r\\nposition. I return thanks to our soldiers for the good services they have\\r\\nrendered, the energy they have shown, the hardships they have endured, and\\r\\nthe blood they have shed for this Union of ours; and I also return thanks,\\r\\nnot only to the soldiers, but to the good citizens of Frederick, and to\\r\\nthe good men, women, and children in this land of ours, for their devotion\\r\\nto this glorious cause; and I say this with no malice in my heart towards\\r\\nthose who have done otherwise. May our children and children\\'s children,\\r\\nfor a thousand generations, continue to enjoy the benefits conferred upon\\r\\nus by a united country, and have cause yet to rejoice under these glorious\\r\\ninstitutions, bequeathed to us by WASHINGTON and his compeers. Now, my\\r\\nfriends, soldiers and citizens, I can only say once more-farewell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM FROM GENERAL HALLECK\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN., WASHINGTON, D. C., October 6, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\\r\\n\\r\\nI am instructed to telegraph you as follows: The President directs that\\r\\nyou cross the Potomac and give battle to the enemy, or drive him south.\\r\\nYour army must move now, while the roads are good. If you cross the river\\r\\nbetween the enemy and Washington, and cover the latter by your operation,\\r\\nyou can be reinforced by thirty thousand men. If you move up the valley of\\r\\nthe Shenandoah, not more than twelve or fifteen thousand can be sent you.\\r\\nThe President advises the interior line between Washington and the enemy,\\r\\nbut does not order it. He is very desirous that your army move as soon as\\r\\npossible. You will immediately report what line you adopt, and when you\\r\\nintend to cross the river; also to what point the reinforcements are to\\r\\nbe sent. It is necessary that the plan of your operations be positively\\r\\ndetermined on, before orders are given for building bridges and repairing\\r\\nrailroads. I am directed to add that the Secretary of War and the\\r\\nGeneral-in-chief fully concur with the President in these directions.\\r\\n\\r\\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 7, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN, Hdqs. Army of the Potomac:\\r\\n\\r\\nYou wish to see your family and I wish to oblige you. It might be left\\r\\nto your own discretion; certainly so, if Mrs. M. could meet you here at\\r\\nWashington.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO T. H. CLAY.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, October 8, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHOMAS H. CLAY, Cincinnati, Ohio:\\r\\n\\r\\nYou cannot have reflected seriously when you ask that I shall order\\r\\nGeneral Morgan\\'s command to Kentucky as a favor because they have marched\\r\\nfrom Cumberland Gap. The precedent established by it would evidently break\\r\\nup the whole army. Buell\\'s old troops, now in pursuit of Bragg, have done\\r\\nmore hard marching recently; and, in fact, if you include marching and\\r\\nfighting, there are scarcely any old troops east or west of the mountains\\r\\nthat have not done as hard service. I sincerely wish war was an easier\\r\\nand pleasanter business than it is; but it does not admit of holidays.\\r\\nOn Morgan\\'s command, where it is now sent, as I understand, depends the\\r\\nquestion whether the enemy will get to the Ohio River in another place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

We have heard nothing\\r\\nsince day before yesterday. Have you anything?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL CURTIS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, D. C., October 12, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS, Saint Louis, Missouri:\\r\\n\\r\\nWould the completion of the railroad some distance further in the\\r\\ndirection of Springfield, Mo., be of any military advantage to you? Please\\r\\nanswer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 13, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR--You remember my speaking to you of what I called your\\r\\nover-cautiousness. Are you not over-cautious when you assume that you\\r\\ncannot do what the enemy is constantly doing? Should you not claim to be\\r\\nat least his equal in prowess, and act upon the claim?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I understand, you telegraphed General Halleck that you cannot subsist\\r\\nyour army at Winchester unless the railroad from Harper\\'s Ferry to that\\r\\npoint be put in working order. But the enemy does now subsist his army\\r\\nat Winchester, at a distance nearly twice as great from railroad\\r\\ntransportation as you would have to do, without the railroad last named.\\r\\nHe now wagons from Culpepper Court-House, which is just about twice as far\\r\\nas you would have to do from Harper\\'s Ferry. He is certainly not more\\r\\nthan half as well provided with wagons as you are. I certainly should be\\r\\npleased for you to have the advantage of the railroad from Harper\\'s Perry\\r\\nto Winchester; but it wastes an the remainder of autumn to give it to you,\\r\\nand, in fact, ignores the question of time, which cannot and must not be\\r\\nignored.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, one of the standard maxims of war, as you know, is \"to operate\\r\\nupon the enemy\\'s communications as much as possible, without exposing your\\r\\nown.\" You seem to act as if this applies against you, but cannot apply in\\r\\nyour favor. Change positions with the enemy, and think you not he would\\r\\nbreak your communication with Richmond within the next twenty-four hours?\\r\\nYou dread his going into Pennsylvania. But if he does so in full force, he\\r\\ngives up his communications to you absolutely, and you have nothing to do\\r\\nbut to follow and ruin him; if he does so with less than full force, fall\\r\\nupon and beat what is left behind all the easier.\\r\\n\\r\\nExclusive of the water line, you are now nearer to Richmond than the enemy\\r\\nis, by the route that you can and he must take. Why can you not reach\\r\\nthere before him, unless you admit that he is more than your equal on a\\r\\nmarch? His route is the arc of a circle, while yours is the chord. The\\r\\nroads are as good on yours as on his.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know I desired, but did not order, you to cross the Potomac below\\r\\ninstead of above the Shenandoah and Blue Ridge. My idea was, that this\\r\\nwould at once menace the enemy\\'s communications, which I would seize if\\r\\nhe would permit. If he should move northward, I would follow him\\r\\nclosely, holding his communications. If he should prevent our seizing his\\r\\ncommunications, and move toward Richmond, I would press closely to him,\\r\\nfight him if a favorable opportunity should present, and at least try to\\r\\nbeat him to Richmond on the inside track. I say \"try;\" if we never try,\\r\\nwe shall never succeed. If he makes a stand at Winchester, moving neither\\r\\nnorth or south, I would fight him there, on the idea that if we cannot\\r\\nbeat him when he bears the wastage of coming to us, we never can when we\\r\\nbear the wastage of going to him. This proposition is a simple truth,\\r\\nand is too important to be lost sight of for a moment. In coming to us\\r\\nhe tenders us an advantage which we should not waive. We should not so\\r\\noperate as to merely drive him away. As we must beat him somewhere or fail\\r\\nfinally, we can do it, if at all, easier near to us than far away. If we\\r\\ncannot beat the enemy where he now is, we never can, he again being within\\r\\nthe entrenchments of Richmond.\\r\\n\\r\\n[And, indeed, the enemy was let back into Richmond and it took another two\\r\\nyears and thousands of dead for McClelland cowardice--if that was all that\\r\\nit was. I still suspect, and I think the evidence is overwhelming that he\\r\\nwas, either secretly a supporter of the South, or, what is more likely,\\r\\na politician readying for a different campaign: that of the Presidency of\\r\\nthe United States.]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecurring to the idea of going to Richmond on the inside track, the\\r\\nfacility of supplying from the side away from the enemy is remarkable, as\\r\\nit were, by the different spokes of a wheel extending from the hub toward\\r\\nthe rim, and this whether you move directly by the chord or on the inside\\r\\narc, hugging the Blue Ridge more closely. The chord line, as you see,\\r\\ncarries you by Aldie, Hay Market, and Fredericksburg; and you see how\\r\\nturnpikes, railroads, and finally the Potomac, by Aquia Creek, meet you at\\r\\nall points from WASHINGTON; the same, only the lines lengthened a little,\\r\\nif you press closer to the Blue Ridge part of the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gaps through the Blue Ridge I understand to be about the following\\r\\ndistances from Harper\\'s Ferry, to wit: Vestal\\'s, 5 miles; Gregory\\'s, 13;\\r\\nSnicker\\'s, 18; Ashby\\'s, 28; Manassas, 38; Chester, 45; and Thornton\\'s,\\r\\n53. I should think it preferable to take the route nearest the enemy,\\r\\ndisabling him to make an important move without your knowledge, and\\r\\ncompelling him to keep his forces together for dread of you. The gaps\\r\\nwould enable you to attack if you should wish. For a great part of the\\r\\nway you would be practically between the enemy and both WASHINGTON and\\r\\nRichmond, enabling us to spare you the greatest number of troops from\\r\\nhere. When at length running for Richmond ahead of him enables him to\\r\\nmove this way, if he does so, turn and attack him in rear. But I think he\\r\\nshould be engaged long before such a point is reached. It is all easy\\r\\nif our troops march as well as the enemy, and it is unmanly to say they\\r\\ncannot do it. This letter is in no sense an order.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR PIERPOINT.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.

And I do hereby authorize and\\r\\nempower the said judge to make and establish such rules and regulations\\r\\nas may be necessary for the exercise of his jurisdiction, and empower the\\r\\nsaid judge to appoint a prosecuting attorney, marshal, and clerk of the\\r\\nsaid court, who shall perform the functions of attorney, marshal, and\\r\\nclerk according to such proceedings and practice as before mentioned and\\r\\nsuch rules and regulations as may be made and established by said judge.\\r\\nThese appointments are to continue during the pleasure of the President,\\r\\nnot extending beyond the military occupation of the city of New Orleans\\r\\nor the restoration of the civil authority in that city and in the State of\\r\\nLouisiana. These officers shall be paid, out of the contingent fund of the\\r\\nWar Department, compensation as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe judge at the rate of $3500 per annum; the prosecuting attorney,\\r\\nincluding the fees, at the rate of $3000 per annum; the marshal, including\\r\\nthe fees, at the rate of $3000 per annum; and the clerk, including the\\r\\nfees, at the rate of $2500 per annum; such compensations to be certified\\r\\nby the Secretary of War.

In all available ways give the\\r\\npeople a show to express their wishes at these elections.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow law, and forms of law, as far as convenient, but at all events get\\r\\nthe expression of the largest number of the people possible. All see how\\r\\nsuch action will connect with and affect the proclamation of September\\r\\n22. Of course the men elected should be gentlemen of character, willing\\r\\nto swear support to the Constitution as of old, and known to be above\\r\\nreasonable suspicion of duplicity.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very respectfully,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

Of course you know the\\r\\nfacts better than I; still two considerations remain: Stuart\\'s cavalry\\r\\noutmarched ours, having certainly done more marked service on the\\r\\nPeninsula and everywhere since. Secondly, will not a movement of our army\\r\\nbe a relief to the cavalry, compelling the enemy to concentrate instead\\r\\nof foraging in squads everywhere?

To be told, after more than\\r\\nfive weeks\\' total inaction of the army, and during which period we have\\r\\nsent to the army every fresh horse we possibly could, amounting in the\\r\\nwhole to 7918, that the cavalry horses were too much fatigued to move,\\r\\npresents a very cheerless, almost hopeless, prospect for the future,\\r\\nand it may have forced something of impatience in my despatch.

In my view there could be no possible object in\\r\\nsuch an election. We do not particularly need members of Congress from\\r\\nthere to enable us to get along with legislation here. What we do want is\\r\\nthe conclusive evidence that respectable citizens of Louisiana are willing\\r\\nto be members of Congress and to swear support to the Constitution, and\\r\\nthat other respectable citizens there are willing to vote for them and\\r\\nsend them. To send a parcel of Northern men here as representatives,\\r\\nelected, as would be understood (and perhaps really so), at the point of\\r\\nthe bayonet, would be disgusting and outrageous; and were I a member of\\r\\nCongress here, I would vote against admitting any such man to a seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nORDER PROHIBITING THE EXPORT OF ARMS AND MUNITIONS OF WAR.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 21, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrdered, That no arms, ammunition, or munitions of war be cleared or\\r\\nallowed to be exported from the United States until further orders. That\\r\\nany clearance for arms, ammunition, or munitions of war issued heretofore\\r\\nby the Treasury Department be vacated, if the articles have not passed\\r\\nwithout the United States, and the articles stopped. That the Secretary\\r\\nof War hold possession of the arms, etc., recently seized by his order at\\r\\nRouse\\'s Point, bound for Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDELAYING TACTICS OF GENERALS\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 22, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR GENERAL BANKS:--Early last week you left me in high hope with your\\r\\nassurance that you would be off with your expedition at the end of that\\r\\nweek, or early in this. It is now the end of this, and I have just been\\r\\noverwhelmed and confounded with the sight of a requisition made by you\\r\\nwhich, I am assured, cannot be filled and got off within an hour short of\\r\\ntwo months. I enclose you a copy of the requisition, in some hope that\\r\\nit is not genuine--that you have never seen it. My dear General, this\\r\\nexpanding and piling up of impedimenta has been, so far, almost our ruin,\\r\\nand will be our final ruin if it is not abandoned. If you had the articles\\r\\nof this requisition upon the wharf, with the necessary animals to make\\r\\nthem of any use, and forage for the animals, you could not get vessels\\r\\ntogether in two weeks to carry the whole, to say nothing of your twenty\\r\\nthousand men; and, having the vessels, you could not put the cargoes\\r\\naboard in two weeks more. And, after all, where you are going you have no\\r\\nuse for them. When you parted with me you had no such ideas in your mind.\\r\\nI know you had not, or you could not have expected to be off so soon as\\r\\nyou said. You must get back to something like the plan you had then, or\\r\\nyour expedition is a failure before you start. You must be off before\\r\\nCongress meets. You would be better off anywhere, and especially where\\r\\nyou are going, for not having a thousand wagons doing nothing but hauling\\r\\nforage to feed the animals that draw them, and taking at least two\\r\\nthousand men to care for the wagons and animals, who otherwise might be\\r\\ntwo thousand good soldiers. Now, dear General, do not think this is an\\r\\nill-natured letter; it is the very reverse. The simple publication of this\\r\\nrequisition would ruin you.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery truly your friend,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO CARL SCHURZ.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 24, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL CARL SCHURZ.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR--I have just received and read your letter of the 20th. The\\r\\npurport of it is that we lost the late elections and the administration\\r\\nis failing because the war is unsuccessful, and that I must not flatter\\r\\nmyself that I am not justly to blame for it. I certainly know that if\\r\\nthe war fails the administration fails, and that I will be blamed for\\r\\nit, whether I deserve it or not. And I ought to be blamed if I could do\\r\\nbetter. You think I could do better; therefore you blame me already.\\r\\nI think I could not do better; therefore I blame you for blaming me. I\\r\\nunderstand you now to be willing to accept the help of men who are not\\r\\nRepublicans, provided they have \"heart in it.\" Agreed. I want no others.\\r\\nBut who is to be the judge of hearts, or of \"heart in it\"? If I must\\r\\ndiscard my own judgment and take yours, I must also take that of others\\r\\nand by the time I should reject all I should be advised to reject, I\\r\\nshould have none left, Republicans or others not even yourself. For be\\r\\nassured, my dear sir, there are men who have \"heart in it\" that think you\\r\\nare performing your part as poorly as you think I am performing mine. I\\r\\ncertainly have been dissatisfied with the slowness of Buell and McClellan;\\r\\nbut before I relieved them I had great fears I should not find successors\\r\\nto them who would do better; and I am sorry to add that I have seen little\\r\\nsince to relieve those fears.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not see clearly the prospect of any more rapid movements. I fear we\\r\\nshall at last find out that the difficulty is in our case rather than in\\r\\nparticular generals. I wish to disparage no one certainly not those\\r\\nwho sympathize with me; but I must say I need success more than I need\\r\\nsympathy, and that I have not seen the so much greater evidence of getting\\r\\nsuccess from my sympathizers than from those who are denounced as the\\r\\ncontrary. It does seem to me that in the field the two classes have been\\r\\nvery much alike in what they have done and what they have failed to do.\\r\\nIn sealing their faith with their blood, Baker and Lyon and Bohien and\\r\\nRichardson, Republicans, did all that men could do; but did they any\\r\\nmore than Kearny and Stevens and Reno and Mansfield, none of whom were\\r\\nRepublicans, and some at least of whom have been bitterly and repeatedly\\r\\ndenounced to me as secession sympathizers? I will not perform the\\r\\nungrateful task of comparing cases of failure.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn answer to your question, \"Has it not been publicly stated in the\\r\\nnewspapers, and apparently proved as a fact, that from the commencement of\\r\\nthe war the enemy was continually supplied with information by some of the\\r\\nconfidential subordinates of as important an officer as Adjutant-General\\r\\nThomas?\" I must say \"No,\" as far as my knowledge extends. And I add that\\r\\nif you can give any tangible evidence upon the subject, I will thank you\\r\\nto come to this city and do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery truly your friend,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 25, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Falmouth, Virginia:\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I should be in boat off Aquia Creek at dark tomorrow (Wednesday)\\r\\nevening, could you, without inconvenience, meet me and pass an hour or two\\r\\nwith me?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO ATTORNEY-GENERAL BATES.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 29, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. ATTORNEY-GENERAL.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--Few things perplex me more than this question between\\r\\nGovernor Gamble and the War Department, as to whether the peculiar force\\r\\norganized by the former in Missouri are State troops or United States\\r\\ntroops. Now, this is either an immaterial or a mischievous question.\\r\\nFirst, if no more is desired than to have it settled what name the force\\r\\nis to be called by, it is immaterial. Secondly, if it is desired for more\\r\\nthan the fixing a name, it can only be to get a position from which to\\r\\ndraw practical inferences; then it is mischievous. Instead of settling one\\r\\ndispute by deciding the question, I should merely furnish a nest-full of\\r\\neggs for hatching new disputes. I believe the force is not strictly either\\r\\n\"State troops\" or \"United States troops.\" It is of mixed character. I\\r\\ntherefore think it is safer, when a practical question arises, to\\r\\ndecide that question directly, and not indirectly by deciding a general\\r\\nabstraction supposed to include it, and also including a great deal more.\\r\\nWithout dispute Governor Gamble appoints the officers of this force, and\\r\\nfills vacancies when they occur. The question now practically in dispute\\r\\nis: Can Governor Gamble make a vacancy by removing an officer or accepting\\r\\na resignation? Now, while it is proper that this question shall be\\r\\nsettled, I do not perceive why either Governor Gamble or the government\\r\\nhere should care which way it is settled. I am perplexed with it only\\r\\nbecause there seems to be pertinacity about it. It seems to me that it\\r\\nmight be either way without injury to the service; or that the offer of\\r\\nthe Secretary of War to let Governor Gamble make vacancies, and he (the\\r\\nSecretary) to ratify the making of them, ought to be satisfactory.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL CURTIS.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cipher.]\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, November 30, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS, Saint Louis, Missouri:\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank Blair wants Manter\\'s Thirty-second, Curly\\'s Twenty seventh, Boyd\\'s\\r\\nTwenty-fourth and the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry to go with him down the\\r\\nriver. I understand it is with you to decide whether he shall have them\\r\\nand if so, and if also it is consistent with the public service, you will\\r\\noblige me a good deal by letting him have them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nON EXECUTING 300 INDIANS\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER TO JUDGE-ADVOCATE-GENERAL.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 1, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nJUDGE-ADVOCATE-GENERAL.\\r\\n\\r\\nSIR:--Three hundred Indians have been sentenced to death in Minnesota by\\r\\na military commission, and execution only awaits my action. I wish your\\r\\nlegal opinion whether if I should conclude to execute only a part of them,\\r\\nI must myself designate which, or could I leave the designation to some\\r\\nofficer on the ground?\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nANNUAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS, DECEMBER 1, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES--Since your\\r\\nlast annual assembling another year of health and bountiful harvests\\r\\nhas passed; and while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a\\r\\nreturn of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best light he gives\\r\\nus, trusting that in his own good time and wise way all will yet be well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken place during\\r\\nthe last year is herewith submitted, in virtual compliance with a request\\r\\nto that effect, made by the House of Representatives near the close of the\\r\\nlast session of Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying\\r\\nthan it has usually been at former periods, it is certainly more\\r\\nsatisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are might\\r\\nreasonably have apprehended. In the month of June last there were some\\r\\ngrounds to expect that the maritime powers which, at the beginning of\\r\\nour domestic difficulties, so unwisely and unnecessarily, as we think,\\r\\nrecognized the insurgents as a belligerent, would soon recede from that\\r\\nposition, which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to\\r\\nour own country. But the temporary reverses which afterward befell the\\r\\nnational arms, and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens\\r\\nabroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe civil war, which has so radically changed, for the moment, the\\r\\noccupations and habits of the American people, has necessarily disturbed\\r\\nthe social condition, and affected very deeply the prosperity, of the\\r\\nnations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily\\r\\nincreasing throughout a period of half a century. It has, at the same\\r\\ntime, excited political ambitions and apprehensions which have produced\\r\\na profound agitation throughout the civilized world. In this unusual\\r\\nagitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversy between\\r\\nforeign states, and between parties or factions in such states. We have\\r\\nattempted no propagandism and acknowledged no revolution, but we have left\\r\\nto every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own affairs.\\r\\nOur struggle has been, of course, contemplated by foreign nations\\r\\nwith reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and often\\r\\nexaggerated effects and consequences resulting to those nations\\r\\nthemselves, nevertheless, complaint on the part of this government, even\\r\\nif it were just, would certainly be unwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the slave trade has\\r\\nbeen put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is\\r\\nan occasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it\\r\\non the part of her Majesty\\'s government has been marked with a jealous\\r\\nrespect for the authority of the United States and the rights of their\\r\\nmoral and loyal citizens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe convention with Hanover for the abolition of the state dues has been\\r\\ncarried into full effect under the act of Congress for that purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nA blockade of 3000 miles of seacoast could not be established and\\r\\nvigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity like\\r\\nthe present without committing occasional mistakes and inflicting\\r\\nunintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their subjects.\\r\\n\\r\\nA civil war occurring in a country where foreigners reside and carry on\\r\\ntrade under treaty stipulations is necessarily fruitful of complaints\\r\\nof the violation of neutral rights. All such collisions tend to excite\\r\\nmisapprehensions, and possibly to produce mutual reclamations between\\r\\nnations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship.\\r\\nIn clear cases of these kinds I have so far as possible heard and\\r\\nredressed complaints which have been presented by friendly powers. There\\r\\nis still, however, a large and an augmenting number of doubtful cases\\r\\nupon which the government is unable to agree with the governments whose\\r\\nprotection is demanded by the claimants. There are, moreover, many cases\\r\\nin which the United States or their citizens suffer wrongs from the naval\\r\\nor military authorities of foreign nations which the governments of those\\r\\nstates are not at once prepared to redress. I have proposed to some of the\\r\\nforeign states thus interested mutual conventions to examine and adjust\\r\\nsuch complaints. This proposition has been made especially to Great\\r\\nBritain, to France, to Spain, and to Prussia. In each case it has been\\r\\nkindly received, but has not yet been formally adopted.\\r\\n\\r\\nI deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owners of\\r\\nthe Norwegian bark Admiral P. Tordenskiold, which vessel was in May, 1861,\\r\\nprevented by the commander of the blockading force off Charleston from\\r\\nleaving that port with cargo, notwithstanding a similar privilege had\\r\\nshortly before been granted to an English vessel. I have directed the\\r\\nSecretary of State to cause the papers in the case to be communicated to\\r\\nthe proper committees.\\r\\n\\r\\nApplications have been made to me by many free Americans of African\\r\\ndescent to favor their emigration, with a view to such colonization as\\r\\nwas contemplated in recent acts of Congress, Other parties, at home\\r\\nand abroad--some from interested motives, others upon patriotic\\r\\nconsiderations, and still others influenced by philanthropic\\r\\nsentiments--have suggested similar measures, while, on the other hand,\\r\\nseveral of the Spanish American republics have protested against the\\r\\nsending of such colonies to their respective territories. Under these\\r\\ncircumstances I have declined to move any such colony to any state without\\r\\nfirst obtaining the consent of its government, with an agreement on its\\r\\npart to receive and protect such emigrants in all the rights of freemen;\\r\\nand I have at the same time offered to the several states situated within\\r\\nthe Tropics, or having colonies there, to negotiate with them, subject to\\r\\nthe advice and consent of the Senate, to favor the voluntary emigration\\r\\nof persons of that class to their respective territories, upon conditions\\r\\nwhich shall be equal, just, and humane. Liberia and Haiti are as yet the\\r\\nonly countries to which colonists of African descent from here could go\\r\\nwith certainty of being received and adopted as citizens; and I regret\\r\\nto say such persons contemplating colonization do not seem so willing to\\r\\nmigrate to those countries as to some others, nor so willing as I think\\r\\ntheir interest demands. I believe, however, opinion among them in this\\r\\nrespect is improving, and that ere long there will be an augmented and\\r\\nconsiderable migration to both these countries from the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new commercial treaty between the United States and the Sultan of\\r\\nTurkey has been carried into execution.\\r\\n\\r\\nA commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the\\r\\nSenate\\'s consent, with Liberia, and a similar negotiation is now pending\\r\\nwith the Republic of Haiti. A considerable improvement of the national\\r\\ncommerce is expected to result from these measures.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia,\\r\\nPrussia, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the\\r\\nother European states remain undisturbed. Very favorable relations also\\r\\ncontinue to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China, and Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the last year there has not only been no change of our previous\\r\\nrelations with the independent states of our own continent, but more\\r\\nfriendly sentiments than have heretofore existed are believed to\\r\\nbe entertained by these neighbors, whose safety and progress are so\\r\\nintimately connected with our own. This statement especially applies to\\r\\nMexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, and Chile.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commission under the convention with the Republic of New Granada\\r\\nclosed its session without having audited and passed upon all the claims\\r\\nwhich were submitted to it. A proposition is pending to revive the\\r\\nconvention, that it may be able to do more complete justice. The joint\\r\\ncommission between the United States and the Republic of Costa Rica has\\r\\ncompleted its labors and submitted its report.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have favored the project for connecting the United States with Europe by\\r\\nan Atlantic telegraph, and a similar project to extend the telegraph from\\r\\nSan Francisco to connect by a Pacific telegraph with the line which is\\r\\nbeing extended across the Russian Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Territories of the United States, with unimportant exceptions, have\\r\\nremained undisturbed by the civil war; and they are exhibiting such\\r\\nevidence of prosperity as justifies an expectation that some of them will\\r\\nsoon be in a condition to be organized as States and be constitutionally\\r\\nadmitted into the Federal Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immense mineral resources of some of those Territories ought to be\\r\\ndeveloped as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would have\\r\\na tendency to improve the revenues of the government and diminish the\\r\\nburdens of the people. It is worthy of your serious consideration whether\\r\\nsome extraordinary measures to promote that end cannot be adopted. The\\r\\nmeans which suggests itself as most likely to be effective is a scientific\\r\\nexploration of the mineral regions in those Territories with a view to the\\r\\npublication of its results at home and in foreign countries--results which\\r\\ncannot fail to be auspicious.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe condition of the finances win claim your most diligent consideration.\\r\\nThe vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations\\r\\nrequired for the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto been met with\\r\\na promptitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstances, and the\\r\\npublic credit has been fully maintained. The continuance of the war,\\r\\nhowever, and the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented\\r\\nforces now in the field demand your best reflections as to the best modes\\r\\nof providing the necessary revenue without injury to business and with the\\r\\nleast possible burdens upon labor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe suspension of specie payments by the banks soon after the commencement\\r\\nof your last session made large issues of United States notes unavoidable.\\r\\nIn no other way could the payment of troops and the satisfaction of other\\r\\njust demands be so economically or so well provided for. The judicious\\r\\nlegislation of Congress, securing the receivability of these notes for\\r\\nloans and internal duties and making them a legal tender for other debts,\\r\\nhas made them an universal currency, and has satisfied, partially at\\r\\nleast, and for the time, the long-felt want of an uniform circulating\\r\\nmedium, saving thereby to the people immense sums in discounts and\\r\\nexchanges.\\r\\n\\r\\nA return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible\\r\\nwith due regard to all interests concerned should ever be kept in view.\\r\\nFluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious, and to reduce\\r\\nthese fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a\\r\\nleading purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt and certain\\r\\nconvertibility, into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best and\\r\\nsurest safeguard against them; and it is extremely doubtful whether a\\r\\ncirculation of United States notes payable in coin and sufficiently large\\r\\nfor the wants of the people can be permanently, usefully, and safely\\r\\nmaintained.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs there, then, any other mode in which the necessary provision for the\\r\\npublic wants can be made and the great advantages of a safe and uniform\\r\\ncurrency secured?\\r\\n\\r\\nI know of none which promises so certain results and is at the same time\\r\\nso unobjectionable as the organization of banking associations, under\\r\\na general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. To such\\r\\nassociations the government might furnish circulating notes, on the\\r\\nsecurity of United States bonds deposited in the treasury. These notes,\\r\\nprepared under the supervision of proper officers, being uniform in\\r\\nappearance and security and convertible always into coin, would at once\\r\\nprotect labor against the evils of a vicious currency and facilitate\\r\\ncommerce by cheap and safe exchanges.\\r\\n\\r\\nA moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate\\r\\nthe United States for the preparation and distribution of the notes and\\r\\na general supervision of the system, and would lighten the burden of\\r\\nthat part of the public debt employed as securities. The public credit,\\r\\nmoreover, would be greatly improved and the negotiation of new loans\\r\\ngreatly facilitated by the steady market demand for government bonds which\\r\\nthe adoption of the proposed system would create.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is an additional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight,\\r\\nin my judgment, that it would reconcile as far as possible all existing\\r\\ninterests by the opportunity offered to existing institutions to\\r\\nreorganize under the act, substituting only the secured uniform national\\r\\ncirculation for the local and various circulation, secured and unsecured,\\r\\nnow issued by them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe receipts into the treasury from all sources, including loans and\\r\\nbalance from the preceding year, for the fiscal year ending on the 30th\\r\\nJune, 1862, were $583,885,247.06, of which sum $49,056,397.62 were derived\\r\\nfrom customs; $1,795,331.73 from the direct tax; from public lands,\\r\\n$152,203.77; from miscellaneous sources, $931,787.64; from loans in all\\r\\nforms, $529,692,460.50. The remainder, $2,257,065.80, was the balance from\\r\\nlast year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disbursements during the same period were: For congressional,\\r\\nexecutive, and judicial purposes, $5,939,009.29; for foreign intercourse,\\r\\n$1,339,710.35; for miscellaneous expenses, including the mints, loans,\\r\\npost-office deficiencies, collection of revenue, and other like charges,\\r\\n$14,129,771.50; for expenses under the Interior Department, $3,102,985.52;\\r\\nunder the War Department, $394,368,407.36; under the Navy Department,\\r\\n$42,674,569.69; for interest on public debt, $13,190,324.45; and for\\r\\npayment of public debt, including reimbursement of temporary loan and\\r\\nredemptions, $96,096,922.09; making an aggregate of $570,841,700.25,\\r\\nand leaving a balance in the treasury on the 1st day of July, 1862, of\\r\\n$13,043,546.81.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be observed that the sum of $96,096,922.09, expended for\\r\\nreimbursements and redemption of public debt, being included also in the\\r\\nloans made, may be properly deducted both from receipts and expenditures,\\r\\nleaving the actual receipts for the year $487,788,324.97, and the\\r\\nexpenditures $474,744,778.16.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther information on the subject of the finances will be found in the\\r\\nreport of the Secretary of the Treasury, to whose statements and views I\\r\\ninvite your most candid and considerate attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reports of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy are herewith\\r\\ntransmitted. These reports, though lengthy, are scarcely more than brief\\r\\nabstracts of the very numerous and extensive transactions and operations\\r\\nconducted through those departments. Nor could I give a summary of them\\r\\nhere upon any principle which would admit of its being much shorter than\\r\\nthe reports themselves. I therefore content myself with laying the reports\\r\\nbefore you and asking your attention to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financial\\r\\ncondition of the Post-Office Department as compared with several preceding\\r\\nyears. The receipts for the fiscal year 1861 amounted to $8,349,296.40,\\r\\nwhich embraced the revenue from all the States of the Union for three\\r\\nquarters of that year. Notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the\\r\\nso-called seceded States during the last fiscal year, the increase of\\r\\nthe correspondence of the loyal States has been sufficient to produce a\\r\\nrevenue during the same year of $8,299,820.90, being only $50,000 less\\r\\nthan was derived from all the States of the Union during the previous\\r\\nyear. The expenditures show a still more favorable result. The amount\\r\\nexpended in 1861 was $13,606,759.11. For the last year the amount has been\\r\\nreduced to $11,125,364.13, showing a decrease of about $2,481,000 in the\\r\\nexpenditures as compared with the preceding year, and about $3,750,000 as\\r\\ncompared with the fiscal year 1860. The deficiency in the department\\r\\nfor the previous year was $4,551,966.98. For the last fiscal year it was\\r\\nreduced to $2,112,814.57. These favorable results are in part owing to the\\r\\ncessation of mail service in the insurrectionary States and in part to a\\r\\ncareful review of all expenditures in that department in the interest of\\r\\neconomy. The efficiency of the postal service, it is believed, has\\r\\nalso been much improved. The Postmaster-General has also opened a\\r\\ncorrespondence through the Department of State with foreign governments\\r\\nproposing a convention of postal representatives for the purpose of\\r\\nsimplifying the rates of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign\\r\\nmails. This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens and to\\r\\nthe commercial interests of this country, has been favorably entertained\\r\\nand agreed to by all the governments from whom replies have been received.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ask the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the\\r\\nPostmaster-General in his report respecting the further legislation\\r\\nrequired, in his opinion, for the benefit of the postal service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secretary of the Interior reports as follows in regard to the public\\r\\nlands:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue. From the 1st\\r\\nJuly, 1861, to the 30th September, 1862, the entire cash receipts from the\\r\\nsale of lands were $137,476.2--a sum much less than the expenses of our\\r\\nland system during the same period. The homestead law, which will take\\r\\neffect on the 1st of January next, offers such inducements to settlers\\r\\nthat sales for cash cannot be expected to an extent sufficient to meet the\\r\\nexpenses of the General Land Office and the cost of surveying and bringing\\r\\nthe land into market.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising from the sales of\\r\\nthe public lands and the sum derived from the same source as reported from\\r\\nthe Treasury Department arises, as I understand, from the fact that the\\r\\nperiods of time, though apparently were not really coincident at the\\r\\nbeginning point, the Treasury report including a considerable sum now\\r\\nwhich had previously been reported from the Interior, sufficiently large\\r\\nto greatly overreach the sum derived from the three months now reported\\r\\nupon by the Interior and not by the Treasury.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian tribes upon our frontiers have during the past year manifested\\r\\na spirit of insubordination, and at several points have engaged in open\\r\\nhostilities against the white settlements in their vicinity. The tribes\\r\\noccupying the Indian country south of Kansas renounced their allegiance to\\r\\nthe United States and entered into treaties with the insurgents. Those\\r\\nwho remained loyal to the United States were driven from the country. The\\r\\nchief of the Cherokees has visited this city for the purpose of restoring\\r\\nthe former relations of the tribe with the United States. He alleges that\\r\\nthey were constrained by superior force to enter into treaties with the\\r\\ninsurgents, and that the United States neglected to furnish the protection\\r\\nwhich their treaty stipulations required.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the month of August last the Sioux Indians in Minnesota attacked\\r\\nthe settlements in their vicinity with extreme ferocity, killing\\r\\nindiscriminately men, women, and children. This attack was wholly\\r\\nunexpected, and therefore no means of defense had been provided. It is\\r\\nestimated that not less than 800 persons were killed by the Indians, and\\r\\na large amount of property was destroyed. How this outbreak was induced is\\r\\nnot definitely known, and suspicions, which may be unjust, need not to\\r\\nbe stated. Information was received by the Indian Bureau from different\\r\\nsources about the time hostilities were commenced that a simultaneous\\r\\nattack was to be made upon white settlements by all the tribes between\\r\\nthe Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. The State of Minnesota\\r\\nhas suffered great injury from this Indian war. A large portion of her\\r\\nterritory has been depopulated, and a severe loss has been sustained\\r\\nby the destruction of property. The people of that State manifest much\\r\\nanxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond the limits of the State as\\r\\na guaranty against future hostilities. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs\\r\\nwill furnish full details. I submit for your especial consideration\\r\\nwhether our Indian system shall not be remodeled. Many wise and good men\\r\\nhave impressed me with the belief that this can be profitably done.\\r\\n\\r\\nI submit a statement of the proceedings of commissioners, which shows the\\r\\nprogress that has been made in the enterprise of constructing the Pacific\\r\\nRailroad. And this suggests the earliest completion of this road, and also\\r\\nthe favorable action of Congress upon the projects now pending before them\\r\\nfor enlarging the capacities of the great canals in New York and Illinois,\\r\\nas being of vital and rapidly increasing importance to the whole nation,\\r\\nand especially to the vast interior region hereinafter to be noticed at\\r\\nsome greater length. I purpose having prepared and laid before you at an\\r\\nearly day some interesting and valuable statistical information upon this\\r\\nsubject. The military and commercial importance of enlarging the Illinois\\r\\nand Michigan Canal and improving the Illinois River is presented in the\\r\\nreport of Colonel Webster to the Secretary of War, and now transmitted to\\r\\nCongress. I respectfully ask attention to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the 15th of May\\r\\nlast, I have caused the Department of Agriculture of the United States to\\r\\nbe organized.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commissioner informs me that within the period of a few months this\\r\\ndepartment has established an extensive system of correspondence and\\r\\nexchanges, both at home and abroad, which promises to effect highly\\r\\nbeneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent\\r\\nimprovements in agriculture, in the introduction of new products, and in\\r\\nthe collection of the agricultural statistics of the different States.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely seeds, cereals,\\r\\nplants, and cuttings, and has already published and liberally diffused\\r\\nmuch valuable information in anticipation of a more elaborate report,\\r\\nwhich will in due time be furnished, embracing some valuable tests in\\r\\nchemical science now in progress in the laboratory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creation of this department was for the more immediate benefit of a\\r\\nlarge class of our most valuable citizens, and I trust that the\\r\\nliberal basis upon which it has been organized will not only meet your\\r\\napprobation, but that it will realize at no distant day all the fondest\\r\\nanticipations of its most sanguine friends and become the fruitful source\\r\\nof advantage to all our people.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 22d day of September last a proclamation was issued by the\\r\\nExecutive, a copy of which is herewith submitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn accordance with the purpose expressed in the second paragraph of that\\r\\npaper, I now respectfully recall your attention to what may be called\\r\\n\"compensated emancipation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, and its\\r\\nlaws. The territory is the only part which is of certain durability.\\r\\n\"One generation passeth away and another generation cometh, but the earth\\r\\nabideth forever.\" It is of the first importance to duly consider and\\r\\nestimate this ever enduring part. That portion of the earth\\'s surface\\r\\nwhich is owned and inhabited by the people of the United States is well\\r\\nadapted to be the home of one national family, and it is not well\\r\\nadapted for two or more. Its vast extent and its variety of climate and\\r\\nproductions are of advantage in this age for one people, whatever they\\r\\nmight have been in former ages. Steam, telegraphs, and intelligence have\\r\\nbrought these to be an advantageous combination for one united people.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the inaugural address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of\\r\\ndisunion as a remedy for the differences between the people of the\\r\\ntwo sections. I did so in language which I cannot improve, and which,\\r\\ntherefore, I beg to repeat:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to\\r\\nbe extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be\\r\\nextended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive-slave clause\\r\\nof the Constitution and the laws for the suppression of the foreign slave\\r\\ntrade are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a\\r\\ncommunity where the moral Sense of the people imperfectly supports the law\\r\\nitself. The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation\\r\\nin both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I think, cannot be\\r\\nperfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases after the separation\\r\\nof the sections than before. The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly\\r\\nsuppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one\\r\\nsection, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not\\r\\nbe surrendered at all by the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Physically speaking, we can not separate. We can not remove our\\r\\nrespective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between\\r\\nthem. A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and\\r\\nbeyond the reach of each other, but the different parts of our country\\r\\ncannot do this. They cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse,\\r\\neither amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible,\\r\\nthen, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory\\r\\nafter separation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends\\r\\ncan make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens\\r\\nthan laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight\\r\\nalways; and when, after much loss on both sides and no gain on either, you\\r\\ncease fighting, the identical old questions, as to terms of intercourse,\\r\\nare again upon you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary\\r\\nupon which to divide. Trace through, from east to west, upon the line\\r\\nbetween the free and slave country, and we shall find a little more than\\r\\none third of its length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated,\\r\\nor soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly all its\\r\\nremaining length are merely surveyors\\' lines, over which people may walk\\r\\nback and forth without any consciousness of their presence. No part of\\r\\nthis line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on\\r\\npaper or parchment as a national boundary. The fact of separation, if it\\r\\ncomes, gives up on the part of the seceding section the fugitive-slave\\r\\nclause along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section\\r\\nseceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be\\r\\nmade to take its place.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there is another difficulty. The great interior region bounded east\\r\\nby the Alleghenies, north by the British dominions, west by the Rocky\\r\\nMountains, and south by the line along which the culture of corn and\\r\\ncotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee,\\r\\nall of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri,\\r\\nKansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of Dakota, Nebraska, and part\\r\\nof Colorado, already has above 10,000,000 people, and will have 50,000,000\\r\\nwithin fifty years if not prevented by any political folly or mistake.\\r\\nIt contains more than one third of the country owned by the United\\r\\nStates--certainly more than 1,000,000 square miles. Once half as populous\\r\\nas Massachusetts already is, it would have more than 75,000,000 people. A\\r\\nglance at the map shows that, territorially speaking, it is the great\\r\\nbody of the Republic. The other parts are but marginal borders to it, the\\r\\nmagnificent region sloping west from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific\\r\\nbeing the deepest and also the richest in undeveloped resources. In the\\r\\nproduction of provisions, grains, grasses, and all which proceed from them\\r\\nthis great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the\\r\\nworld. Ascertain from statistics the small proportion of the region which\\r\\nhas yet been brought into cultivation, and also the large and rapidly\\r\\nincreasing amount of products, and we shall be overwhelmed with\\r\\nthe magnitude of the prospect presented. And yet this region has no\\r\\nseacoast--touches no ocean anywhere. As part of one nation, its people\\r\\nnow find, and may forever find, their way to Europe by New York, to South\\r\\nAmerica and Africa by New Orleans, and to Asia by San Francisco; but\\r\\nseparate our common country into two nations, as designed by the present\\r\\nrebellion, and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off\\r\\nfrom some one or more of these outlets, not perhaps by a physical barrier,\\r\\nbut by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this is true, wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed. Place\\r\\nit between the now free and slave country, or place it south of Kentucky\\r\\nor north of Ohio, and still the truth remains that none south of it can\\r\\ntrade to any port or place north of it, and none north of it can trade to\\r\\nany port or place south of it, except upon terms dictated by a government\\r\\nforeign to them. These outlets, east, west, and south, are indispensable\\r\\nto the well-being of the people inhabiting and to inhabit this vast\\r\\ninterior region. Which of the three may be the best is no proper question.\\r\\nAll are better than either, and all of right belong to that people and to\\r\\ntheir successors forever. True to themselves, they will not ask where a\\r\\nline of separation shall be, but will vow rather that there shall be no\\r\\nsuch line.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to\\r\\nand through them to the great outside world. They, too, and each of them,\\r\\nmust have access to this Egypt of the West without paying toll at the\\r\\ncrossing of any national boundary.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur national strife springs not from our permanent part; not from the land\\r\\nwe inhabit; not from our national homestead. There is no possible severing\\r\\nof this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us. In all its\\r\\nadaptations and aptitudes it demands union and abhors separation. In fact,\\r\\nit would ere long force reunion, however much of blood and treasure the\\r\\nseparation might have cost.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur strife pertains to ourselves--to the passing generations of men--and\\r\\nit can without convulsion be hushed forever with the passing of one\\r\\ngeneration.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this view I recommend the adoption of the following resolution and\\r\\narticles amendatory to the Constitution of the United States:\\r\\n\\r\\nResolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States\\r\\nof America, in Congress assembled, (two thirds of both Houses concurring),\\r\\nThat the following articles be proposed to the Legislatures (or\\r\\nconventions) of the several States as amendments to the Constitution of\\r\\nthe United States, all or any of which articles, when ratified by three\\r\\nfourths of the said Legislatures (or conventions), to be valid as part or\\r\\nparts of the said Constitution, viz.\\r\\n\\r\\nART.--Every State wherein slavery now exists which shall abolish the same\\r\\ntherein at any time or times before the 1st day of January, A.D. 1900,\\r\\nshall receive compensation from the United States as follows, to wit:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President of the United States shall deliver to every such State bonds\\r\\nof the United States bearing interest at the rate of -- per cent. per\\r\\nannum to an amount equal to the aggregate sum of ------ for each slave\\r\\nshown to have been therein by the Eighth Census of the United States, said\\r\\nbonds to be delivered to such State by instalments or in one parcel at\\r\\nthe completion of the abolishment, accordingly as the same shall have been\\r\\ngradual or at one time within such State; and interest shall begin to run\\r\\nupon any such bond only from the proper time of its delivery as aforesaid.\\r\\nAny State having received bonds as aforesaid and afterwards reintroducing\\r\\nor tolerating slavery therein shall refund to the United States the bonds\\r\\nso received, or the value thereof, and all interest paid thereon.\\r\\n\\r\\nART.--All slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the chances of\\r\\nthe war at any time before the end of the rebellion shall be forever\\r\\nfree; but all owners of such who shall not have been disloyal shall be\\r\\ncompensated for them at the same rates as is provided for States adopting\\r\\nabolishment of slavery, but in such way that no slave shall be twice\\r\\naccounted for.\\r\\n\\r\\nART.--Congress may appropriate money and otherwise provide for colonizing\\r\\nfree colored persons with their own consent at any place or places without\\r\\nthe United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nI beg indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at some length.\\r\\nWithout slavery the rebellion could never have existed; without slavery it\\r\\ncould not continue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the friends of the Union there is great diversity of sentiment and\\r\\nof policy in regard to slavery and the African race amongst us. Some\\r\\nwould perpetuate slavery; some would abolish it suddenly and without\\r\\ncompensation; some would abolish it gradually and with compensation; some\\r\\nwould remove the freed people from us, and some would retain them with us;\\r\\nand there are yet other minor diversities. Because of these diversities we\\r\\nwaste much strength in struggles among ourselves. By mutual concession we\\r\\nshould harmonize and act together. This would be compromise, but it would\\r\\nbe compromise among the friends and not with the enemies of the Union.\\r\\nThese articles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual concessions.\\r\\nIf the plan shall be adopted, it is assumed that emancipation will follow,\\r\\nat least in several of the States.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the first article, the main points are, first, the emancipation;\\r\\nsecondly, the length of time for consummating it (thirty-seven years);\\r\\nand, thirdly, the compensation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual\\r\\nslavery, but the length of time should greatly mitigate their\\r\\ndissatisfaction. The time spares both races from the evils of sudden\\r\\nderangement--in fact, from the necessity of any derangement--while most\\r\\nof those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure\\r\\nwill have passed away before its consummation. They will never see it.\\r\\nAnother class will hail the prospect of emancipation, but will deprecate\\r\\nthe length of time. They will feel that it gives too little to the now\\r\\nliving slaves. But it really gives them much. It saves them from the\\r\\nvagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate emancipation in\\r\\nlocalities where their numbers are very great, and it gives the inspiring\\r\\nassurance that their posterity shall be free forever. The plan leaves to\\r\\neach State choosing to act under it to abolish slavery now or at the end\\r\\nof the century, or at any intermediate tune, or by degrees extending\\r\\nover the whole or any part of the period, and it obliges no two States to\\r\\nproceed alike. It also provides for compensation, and generally the\\r\\nmode of making it. This, it would seem, must further mitigate the\\r\\ndissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual slavery, and especially of\\r\\nthose who are to receive the compensation. Doubtless some of those who are\\r\\nto pay and not to receive will object. Yet the measure is both just and\\r\\neconomical. In a certain sense the liberation of slaves is the destruction\\r\\nof property--property acquired by descent or by purchase, the same as any\\r\\nother property. It is no less true for having been often said that the\\r\\npeople of the South are not more responsible for the original introduction\\r\\nof this property than are the people of the North; and when it is\\r\\nremembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar and share the\\r\\nprofits of dealing in them, it may not be quite safe to say that the South\\r\\nhas been more responsible than the North for its continuance. If, then,\\r\\nfor a common object this property is to be sacrificed, is it not just that\\r\\nit be done at a common charge?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if with less money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve the\\r\\nbenefits of the Union by this means than we can by the war alone, is it\\r\\nnot also economical to do it? Let us consider it, then. Let us ascertain\\r\\nthe sum we have expended in the war Since compensated emancipation\\r\\nwas proposed last March, and consider whether if that measure had been\\r\\npromptly accepted by even some of the slave States the same sum would not\\r\\nhave done more to close the war than has been otherwise done. If so,\\r\\nthe measure would save money, and in that view would be a prudent and\\r\\neconomical measure. Certainly it is not so easy to pay something as it is\\r\\nto pay nothing, but it is easier to pay a large sum than it is to pay a\\r\\nlarger one. And it is easier to pay any sum when we are able than it is to\\r\\npay it before we are able. The war requires large sums, and requires\\r\\nthem at once. The aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation of\\r\\ncourse would be large. But it would require no ready cash, nor the bonds\\r\\neven any faster than the emancipation progresses. This might not, and\\r\\nprobably would not, close before the end of the thirty-seven years. At\\r\\nthat time we shall probably have a hundred millions of people to share the\\r\\nburden, instead of thirty-one millions as now. And not only so, but the\\r\\nincrease of our population may be expected to continue for a long time\\r\\nafter that period as rapidly as before, because our territory will not\\r\\nhave become full. I do not state this inconsiderately. At the same ratio\\r\\nof increase which we have maintained, on an average, from our first\\r\\nnational census, in 1790, until that of 1860, we should in 1900 have a\\r\\npopulation of 103,208,415. And why may we not continue that ratio far\\r\\nbeyond that period? Our abundant room, our broad national homestead,\\r\\nis our ample resource. Were our territory as limited as are the British\\r\\nIsles, very certainly our population could not expand as stated. Instead\\r\\nof receiving the foreign born as now, we should be compelled to send part\\r\\nof the native born away. But such is not our condition. We have 2,963,000\\r\\nsquare miles. Europe has 3,800,000, with a population averaging 73 persons\\r\\nto the square mile. Why may not our country at some time average as many?\\r\\nIs it less fertile? Has it more waste surface by mountains, rivers,\\r\\nlakes, deserts, or other causes? Is it inferior to Europe in any natural\\r\\nadvantage? If, then, we are at some time to be as populous as Europe, how\\r\\nsoon? As to when this may be, we can judge by the past and the present;\\r\\nas to when it will be, if ever, depends much on whether we maintain the\\r\\nUnion...............\\r\\n\\r\\n          [a page of tables of projected statistics]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese figures show that our country may be as populous as Europe now is\\r\\nat some point between 1920 and 1930, say about 1925--our territory, at 73\\r\\npersons to the square mile, being of capacity to contain 217,186,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish the chance\\r\\nby the folly and evils of disunion or by long and exhausting war springing\\r\\nfrom the only great element of national discord among us. While it cannot\\r\\nbe foreseen exactly how much one huge example of secession, breeding\\r\\nlesser ones indefinitely, would retard population, civilization, and\\r\\nprosperity, no one can doubt that the extent of it would be very great and\\r\\ninjurious.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposed emancipation would shorten the war, perpetuate peace,\\r\\ninsure this increase of population, and proportionately the wealth of\\r\\nthe country. With these we should pay all the emancipation would cost,\\r\\ntogether with our other debt, easier than we should pay our other debt\\r\\nwithout it. If we had allowed our old national debt to run at six per\\r\\ncent. per annum, simple interest, from the end of our revolutionary\\r\\nstruggle until to-day, without paying anything on either principal or\\r\\ninterest, each man of us would owe less upon that debt now than each man\\r\\nowed upon it then; and this because our increase of men through the\\r\\nwhole period has been greater than six per cent.--has run faster than the\\r\\ninterest upon the debt. Thus time alone relieves a debtor nation, so long\\r\\nas its population increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its\\r\\ndebt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly due,\\r\\nbut it shows the great importance of time in this connection--the great\\r\\nadvantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number\\r\\n100,000,000 what by a different policy we would have to pay now, when\\r\\nwe number but 31,000,000. In a word, it shows that a dollar will be much\\r\\nharder to pay for the war than will be a dollar for emancipation on the\\r\\nproposed plan. And then the latter will cost no blood, no precious life.\\r\\nIt will be a saving of both.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the second article, I think it would be impracticable to return\\r\\nto bondage the class of persons therein contemplated. Some of them,\\r\\ndoubtless, in the property sense belong to loyal owners, and hence\\r\\nProvision is made in this article for compensating such.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third article relates to the future of the freed people. It does not\\r\\noblige, but merely authorizes Congress to aid in colonizing such as may\\r\\nconsent. This ought nut to be regarded as objectionable on the one hand or\\r\\non the other, insomuch as it comes to nothing unless by the mutual\\r\\nconsent of the people to be deported and the American voters through their\\r\\nrepresentatives in Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot make it better known than it already is that I strongly favor\\r\\ncolonization; and yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against\\r\\nfree colored persons remaining in the country which is largely imaginary,\\r\\nif not sometimes malicious.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is insisted that their presence would injure and displace white labor\\r\\nand white laborers. If there ever could be a proper time for mere catch\\r\\narguments that time surely is not now. In times like the present men\\r\\nshould utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible\\r\\nthrough time and in eternity. Is it true, then, that colored people can\\r\\ndisplace any more white labor by being free than by remaining slaves?\\r\\nIf they stay in their old places, they jostle no white laborers; if they\\r\\nleave their old places, they leave them open to white laborers. Logically,\\r\\nthere is neither more nor less of it. Emancipation, even without\\r\\ndeportation, would probably enhance the wages of white labor, and very\\r\\nsurely would not reduce them. Thus the customary amount of labor would\\r\\nstill have to be performed. The freed people would surely not do more than\\r\\ntheir old proportion of it, and very probably for a time would do less,\\r\\nleaving an increased part to white laborers, bringing their labor\\r\\ninto greater demand, and consequently enhancing the wages of it. With\\r\\ndeportation, even to a limited extent, enhanced wages to white labor\\r\\nis mathematically certain. Labor is like any other commodity in the\\r\\nmarket-increase the demand for it and you increase the price of it. Reduce\\r\\nthe supply of black labor by colonizing the black laborer out of the\\r\\ncountry, and by precisely so much you increase the demand for and wages of\\r\\nwhite labor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the\\r\\nwhole land. Are they not already in the land? Will liberation make them\\r\\nany more numerous? Equally distributed among the whites of the whole\\r\\ncountry, and there would be but one colored to seven whites. Could the\\r\\none in any way greatly disturb the seven? There are many communities now\\r\\nhaving more than one free colored person to seven whites, and this without\\r\\nany apparent consciousness of evil from it. The District of Columbia\\r\\nand the States of Maryland and Delaware are all in this condition. The\\r\\nDistrict has more than one free colored to six whites, and yet in its\\r\\nfrequent petitions to Congress I believe it has never presented the\\r\\npresence of free colored persons as one of its grievances. But why should\\r\\nemancipation South send the free people North? People of any color seldom\\r\\nrun unless there be something to run from. Heretofore colored people to\\r\\nsome extent have fled North from bondage, and now, perhaps, from both\\r\\nbondage and destitution. But if gradual emancipation and deportation be\\r\\nadopted, they will have neither to flee from. Their old masters will give\\r\\nthem wages at least until new laborers can be procured, and the freedmen\\r\\nin turn will gladly give their labor for the wages till new homes can be\\r\\nfound for them in congenial climes and with people of their own blood and\\r\\nrace. This proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved.\\r\\nAnd in any event, cannot the North decide for itself whether to receive\\r\\nthem?\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, as practice proves more than theory in any case, has there been\\r\\nany irruption of colored people northward because of the abolishment of\\r\\nslavery in this District last spring?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I have said of the proportion of free colored persons to the whites\\r\\nin the District is from the census of 1860, having no reference to\\r\\npersons called contrabands nor to those made free by the act of Congress\\r\\nabolishing slavery here.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan consisting of these articles is recommended, not but that a\\r\\nrestoration of the national authority would be accepted without its\\r\\nadoption.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor will the war nor proceedings under the proclamation of September 22,\\r\\n1862, be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan. Its timely\\r\\nadoption, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and thereby stay both.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress provide\\r\\nby law for compensating any State which may adopt emancipation before this\\r\\nplan shall have been acted upon is hereby earnestly renewed. Such would be\\r\\nonly an advance part of the plan, and the same arguments apply to both.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion of, but additional\\r\\nto, all others for restoring and preserving the national authority\\r\\nthroughout the Union. The subject is presented exclusively in its\\r\\neconomical aspect. The plan would, I am confident, secure peace more\\r\\nspeedily and maintain it more permanently than can be done by force alone,\\r\\nwhile all it would cost, considering amounts and manner of payment and\\r\\ntimes of payment, would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of\\r\\nthe war if we rely solely upon force. It is much, very much, that it would\\r\\ncost no blood at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law. It cannot become\\r\\nsuch without the concurrence of, first, two thirds of Congress, and\\r\\nafterwards three fourths of the States. The requisite three fourths of\\r\\nthe States will necessarily include seven of the slave States. Their\\r\\nconcurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their severally adopting\\r\\nemancipation at no very distant day upon the new constitutional terms.\\r\\nThis assurance would end the struggle now and save the Union forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to\\r\\nthe Congress of the nation by the chief magistrate of the nation, nor do\\r\\nI forget that some of you are my seniors, nor that many of you have more\\r\\nexperience than I in the conduct of public affairs. Yet I trust that in\\r\\nview of the great responsibility resting upon me you will perceive no want\\r\\nof respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness I may seem to display.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten\\r\\nthe war, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood? Is\\r\\nit doubted that it would restore the national authority and national\\r\\nprosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely? Is it doubted that we\\r\\nhere--Congress and executive--can secure its adoption? Will not the good\\r\\npeople respond to a united and earnest appeal from us? Can we, can they,\\r\\nby any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital objects?\\r\\nWe can succeed only by concert. It is not \"Can any of us imagine better?\"\\r\\nbut \"Can we all do better?\" Object whatsoever is possible, still the\\r\\nquestion recurs, \"Can we do better?\" The dogmas of the quiet past\\r\\nare inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with\\r\\ndifficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we\\r\\nmust think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we\\r\\nshall save our country.\\r\\n\\r\\nFellow-citizens, we can not escape history. We of this Congress and this\\r\\nadministration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal\\r\\nsignificance or insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery\\r\\ntrial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the\\r\\nlatest generation. We say we are for the Union. The world will not forget\\r\\nthat we say this. We know how to save the Union. The world knows we\\r\\ndo know how to save it. We, even we here, hold the power and bear the\\r\\nresponsibility. In giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the\\r\\nfree--honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve. We shall nobly\\r\\nsave or meanly lose the last, best hope of earth.

LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, December 3, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 3d of November, 1861, a collision took place off the coast of Cuba\\r\\nbetween the United States war steamer San Jacinto and the French brig\\r\\nJules et Marie, resulting in serious damage to the latter. The obligation\\r\\nof this Government to make amends therefor could not be questioned if the\\r\\ninjury resulted from any fault On the part of the San Jacinto. With a view\\r\\nto ascertain this, the subject was referred to a commission of the United\\r\\nStates and French naval officers at New York, with a naval officer of\\r\\nItaly as an arbiter. The conclusion arrived at was that the collision was\\r\\noccasioned by the failure of the San Jacinto seasonably to reverse\\r\\nher engine. It then became necessary to ascertain the amount of\\r\\nindemnification due to the injured party. The United States consul-general\\r\\nat Havana was consequently instructed to confer with the consul of France\\r\\non this point, and they have determined that the sum of $9,500 is an\\r\\nequitable allowance under the circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recommend an appropriation of this sum for the benefit of the owners of\\r\\nthe Jules et Marie.\\r\\n\\r\\nA copy of the letter of Mr. Shufeldt, the consul-general of the United\\r\\nStates at Havana, to the Secretary of State on the subject is herewith\\r\\ntransmitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

C.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend,\\r\\nthat Commander John L.

DuBois.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--In the summer of 1859, when Mr. Freeman visited Springfield,\\r\\nIllinois, in relation to the McCallister and Stebbins bonds I promised him\\r\\nthat, upon certain conditions, I would ask members of the Legislature to\\r\\ngive him a full and fair hearing of his case. I do not now remember, nor\\r\\nhave I time to recall, exactly what the conditions were, nor whether they\\r\\nwere completely performed; but there can be in no case any harm [in] his\\r\\nhaving a full and fair hearing, and I sincerely wish it may be given him.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember 11, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn compliance with your resolution of December 5, 1862, requesting the\\r\\nPresident \"to furnish the Senate with all information in his possession\\r\\ntouching the late Indian barbarities in the State of Minnesota, and also\\r\\nthe evidence in his possession upon which some of the principal actors\\r\\nand head men were tried and condemned to death,\" I have the honor to\\r\\nstate that on receipt of said resolution, I transmitted the same to the\\r\\nSecretary of the Interior, accompanied by a note, a copy of which is\\r\\nherewith inclosed, marked A, and in response to which I received, through\\r\\nthat department, a letter of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, a copy of\\r\\nwhich is herewith inclosed, marked B.\\r\\n\\r\\nI further state that on the eighth day of November last I received a long\\r\\ntelegraphic despatch from Major-General Pope, at St. Paul, Minnesota,\\r\\nsimply announcing the names of the persons sentenced to be hanged. I\\r\\nimmediately telegraphed to have transcripts of the records in all cases\\r\\nforwarded to me, which transcripts, however, did not reach me until two\\r\\nor three days before the present meeting of Congress. Meantime I received,\\r\\nthrough telegraphic despatches and otherwise, appeals in behalf of the\\r\\ncondemned, appeals for their execution, and expressions of opinion as to\\r\\nthe proper policy in regard to them and to the Indians generally in that\\r\\nvicinity, none of which, as I understand, falls within the scope of your\\r\\ninquiry. After the arrival of the transcripts of records, but before I had\\r\\nsufficient opportunity to examine them, I received a joint letter from\\r\\none of the senators and two of the representatives from Minnesota, which\\r\\ncontains some statements of fact not found in the records of the trials,\\r\\nand for which reason I herewith transmit a copy, marked C. I also, for\\r\\nthe same reason, inclose a printed memorial of the citizens of St. Paul,\\r\\naddressed to me, and forwarded with the letter aforesaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnxious to not act with so much clemency as to encourage another outbreak\\r\\non the one hand, nor with so much severity as to be real cruelty on the\\r\\nother, I caused a careful examination of the records of trials to be made,\\r\\nin view of first ordering the execution of such as had been proved guilty\\r\\nof violating females. Contrary to my expectation, only two of this class\\r\\nwere found. I then directed a further examination and a classification of\\r\\nall who were proven to have participated in massacres, as distinguished\\r\\nfrom participation in battles. This class numbered forty, and included\\r\\nthe two convicted of female violation. One of the number is strongly\\r\\nrecommended, by the commission which tried them, for commutation to ten\\r\\nyears imprisonment I have ordered the other thirty-nine to be executed on\\r\\nFriday the 19th instant. The order was despatched from here on Monday, the\\r\\n8th instant, by a messenger to General Sibley, and a copy of which order\\r\\nis herewith transmitted, marked D.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn abstract of the evidence as to the forty is herewith inclosed, marked\\r\\nE.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo avoid the immense amount of copying, I lay before the Senate the\\r\\noriginal transcripts of the records of trials, as received by me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is as full and complete a response to the resolution as it is in my\\r\\npower to make.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember 12, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\\r\\n\\r\\nI have in my possession three valuable swords, formerly the property of\\r\\nGeneral David E. Twiggs, which I now place at the disposal of Congress.\\r\\nThey are forwarded to me from New Orleans by Major-General Benjamin F.\\r\\nButler. If they or any of them shall be by Congress disposed of in reward\\r\\nor compliment of military service, I think General Butler is entitled to\\r\\nthe first consideration. A copy of the General\\'s letter to me accompanying\\r\\nthe swords is herewith transmitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO FERNANDO WOOD.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON DECEMBER 12, 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. FERNANDO WOOD.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your letter of the 8th, with the accompanying note of same\\r\\ndate, was received yesterday. The most important paragraph in the letter,\\r\\nas I consider, is in these words:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the 25th of November last I was advised by an authority which I deemed\\r\\nlikely to be well informed, as well as reliable and truthful, that the\\r\\nSouthern States would send representatives to the next Congress, provided\\r\\nthat a full and general amnesty should permit them to do so. No guarantee\\r\\nor terms were asked for other than the amnesty referred to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI strongly suspect your information will prove to be groundless;\\r\\nnevertheless, I thank you for communicating it to me. Understanding the\\r\\nphrase in the paragraph just quoted--\"the Southern States would send\\r\\nrepresentatives to the next Congress\"--to be substantially the same as\\r\\nthat \"the people of the Southern States would cease resistance, and would\\r\\nreinaugurate, submit to, and maintain the national authority within the\\r\\nlimits of such States, under the Constitution of the United States,\" I say\\r\\nthat in such case the war would cease on the part of the United States;\\r\\nand that if within a reasonable time \"a full and general amnesty\" were\\r\\nnecessary to such end, it would not be withheld.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not think it would be proper now to communicate this, formally or\\r\\ninformally, to the people of the Southern States. My belief is that they\\r\\nalready know it; and when they choose, if ever, they can communicate\\r\\nwith me unequivocally. Nor do I think it proper now to suspend military\\r\\noperations to try any experiment of negotiation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should nevertheless receive with great pleasure the exact information\\r\\nyou now have, and also such other as you may in any way obtain. Such\\r\\ninformation might be more valuable before the 1st of January than\\r\\nafterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile there is nothing in this letter which I shall dread to see in\\r\\nhistory, it is, perhaps, better for the present that its existence should\\r\\nnot become public. I therefore have to request that you will regard it as\\r\\nconfidential.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour obedient servant,\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

You are sure to be happy again.\\r\\nTo know this, which is certainly true, will make you some less miserable\\r\\nnow. I have had experience enough to know what I say, and you need only to\\r\\nbelieve it to feel better at once. The memory of your dear father, instead\\r\\nof an agony, will yet be a sad, sweet feeling in your heart, of a purer\\r\\nand holier sort than you have known before.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease present my kind regards to your afflicted mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour sincere friend,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

If in\\r\\nsuch a difficulty as this you do not help, you fail me precisely in the\\r\\npoint for which I sought your assistance You know what General Burnside\\'s\\r\\nplan is, and it is my wish that you go with him to the ground, examine it\\r\\nas far as practicable, confer with the officers, getting their judgment,\\r\\nand ascertaining their temper--in a word, gather all the elements for\\r\\nforming a judgment of your own, and then tell General Burnside that you\\r\\ndo approve or that you do not approve his plan. Your military skill is\\r\\nuseless to me if you will not do this.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL S. R. CURTIS.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON JANUARY 2, 1863\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of December 29 by the hand of Mr. Strong is just\\r\\nreceived. The day I telegraphed you suspending the order in relation to\\r\\nDr. McPheeters, he, with Mr. Bates, the Attorney-General, appeared before\\r\\nme and left with me a copy of the order mentioned. The doctor also showed\\r\\nme the Copy of an oath which he said he had taken, which is indeed very\\r\\nstrong and specific. He also verbally assured me that he had constantly\\r\\nprayed in church for the President and government, as he had always done\\r\\nbefore the present war. In looking over the recitals in your order, I do\\r\\nnot see that this matter of the prayer, as he states it, is negatived,\\r\\nnor that any violation of his oath is charged nor, in fact, that anything\\r\\nspecific is alleged against him. The charges are all general: that he has\\r\\na rebel wife and rebel relations, that he sympathies with rebels, and\\r\\nthat he exercises rebel influence. Now, after talking with him, I tell\\r\\nyou frankly I believe he does sympathize with the rebels, but the question\\r\\nremains whether such a man, of unquestioned good moral character, who has\\r\\ntaken such an oath as he has, and cannot even be charged with violating\\r\\nit, and who can be charged with no other specific act or omission, can,\\r\\nwith safety to the government, be exiled upon the suspicion of his secret\\r\\nsympathies. But I agree that this must be left to you, who are on the\\r\\nspot; and if, after all, you think the public good requires his removal,\\r\\nmy suspension of the order is withdrawn, only with this qualification,\\r\\nthat the time during the suspension is not to be counted against him. I\\r\\nhave promised him this. But I must add that the United States Government\\r\\nmust not, as by this order, undertake to run the churches. When an\\r\\nindividual in a church or out of it becomes dangerous to the public\\r\\ninterest, he must be checked; but let the churches, as such, take care\\r\\nof themselves. It will not do for the United States to appoint trustees,\\r\\nsupervisors, or other agents for the churches.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\nP. S.--The committee composed of Messrs. Yeatman and Filley (Mr. Broadhead\\r\\nnot attending) has presented your letter and the memorial of sundry\\r\\ncitizens. On the whole subject embraced exercise your best judgment,\\r\\nwith a sole view to the public interest, and I will not interfere without\\r\\nhearing you.\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN., January 3, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO SECRETARY WELLES.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 4, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. GIDEON WELLES, Secretary of the Navy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR SIR:--As many persons who come well recommended for loyalty and\\r\\nservice to the Union cause, and who are refugees from rebel oppression in\\r\\nthe State of Virginia, make application to me for authority and permission\\r\\nto remove their families and property to protection within the Union\\r\\nlines, by means of our armed gunboats on the Potomac River and Chesapeake\\r\\nBay, you are hereby requested to hear and consider all such applications,\\r\\nand to grant such assistance to this class of persons as in your judgment\\r\\ntheir merits may render proper, and as may in each case be consistent with\\r\\nthe perfect and complete efficiency of the naval service and with military\\r\\nexpediency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL S. L CURTIS.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 5, 1863\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am having a good deal of trouble with Missouri matters,\\r\\nand I now sit down to write you particularly about it. One class of\\r\\nfriends believe in greater severity and another in greater leniency in\\r\\nregard to arrests, banishments, and assessments. As usual in such cases,\\r\\neach questions the other\\'s motives. On the one hand, it is insisted that\\r\\nGovernor Gamble\\'s unionism, at most, is not better than a secondary spring\\r\\nof action; that hunkerism and a wish for political influence stand\\r\\nbefore Unionism with him. On the other hand, it is urged that arrests,\\r\\nbanishments, and assessments are made more for private malice, revenge,\\r\\nand pecuniary interest than for the public good. This morning I was told,\\r\\nby a gentleman who I have no doubt believes what he says, that in one\\r\\ncase of assessments for $10,000 the different persons who paid compared\\r\\nreceipts, and found they had paid $30,000. If this be true, the inference\\r\\nis that the collecting agents pocketed the odd $20,000. And true or not\\r\\nin the instance, nothing but the sternest necessity can justify the\\r\\nmaking and maintaining of a system so liable to such abuses. Doubtless the\\r\\nnecessity for the making of the system in Missouri did exist, and whether\\r\\nit continues for the maintenance of it is now a practical and very\\r\\nimportant question. Some days ago Governor Gamble telegraphed me, asking\\r\\nthat the assessments outside of St. Louis County might be suspended, as\\r\\nthey already have been within it, and this morning all the members of\\r\\nCongress here from Missouri but one laid a paper before me asking the same\\r\\nthing. Now, my belief is that Governor Gamble is an honest and true man,\\r\\nnot less so than yourself; that you and he could confer together on this\\r\\nand other Missouri questions with great advantage to the public; that each\\r\\nknows something which the other does not; and that acting together you\\r\\ncould about double your stock of pertinent information. May I not hope\\r\\nthat you and he will attempt this? I could at once safely do (or you could\\r\\nsafely do without me) whatever you and he agree upon. There is absolutely\\r\\nno reason why you should not agree.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours as ever,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\nP. S.--I forgot to say that Hon. James S. Rollins, member of Congress\\r\\nfrom one of the Missouri districts, wishes that, upon his personal\\r\\nresponsibility, Rev. John M. Robinson, of Columbia, Missouri; James L.\\r\\nMatthews, of Boone County, Missouri; and James L. Stephens, also of Boone\\r\\nCounty, Missouri, may be allowed to return to their respective homes.\\r\\nMajor Rollins leaves with me very strong papers from the neighbors of\\r\\nthese men, whom he says he knows to be true men. He also says he has many\\r\\nconstituents who he thinks are rightly exiled, but that he thinks these\\r\\nthree should be allowed to return. Please look into the case, and oblige\\r\\nMajor Rollins if you consistently can.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Copy sent to Governor Gamble.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO CALEB RUSSELL AND SALLIE A. FENTON.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 5, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY GOOD FRIENDS: The Honorable Senator Harlan has just placed in my hands\\r\\nyour letter of the 27th of December, which I have read with pleasure and\\r\\ngratitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is most cheering and encouraging for me to know that in the efforts\\r\\nwhich I have made and am making for the restoration of a righteous peace\\r\\nto our country, I am upheld and sustained by the good wishes and prayers\\r\\nof God\\'s people. No one is more deeply than myself aware that without His\\r\\nfavor our highest wisdom is but as foolishness and that our most strenuous\\r\\nefforts would avail nothing in the shadow of His displeasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am conscious of no desire for my country\\'s welfare that is not in\\r\\nconsonance with His will, and of no plan upon which we may not ask His\\r\\nblessing. It seems to me that if there be one subject upon which all good\\r\\nmen may unitedly agree, it is imploring the gracious favor of the God of\\r\\nNations upon the struggles our people are making for the preservation of\\r\\ntheir precious birthright of civil and religious liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery truly your friend;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

GRATZ BROWN, Jefferson City, Mo.:\\r\\n\\r\\nYours of to-day just received. The administration takes no part between\\r\\nits friends in Missouri, of whom I, at least, consider you one; and I have\\r\\nnever before had an intimation that appointees there were interfering, or\\r\\nwere inclined to interfere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCORRESPONDENCE WITH GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE, JANUARY 8, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC January 5, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\\r\\n\\r\\nSince my return to the army I have become more than ever convinced that\\r\\nthe general officers of this command are almost unanimously opposed to\\r\\nanother crossing of the river; but I am still of the opinion that the\\r\\ncrossing should be attempted, and I have accordingly issued orders to the\\r\\nengineers and artillery to prepare for it. There is much hazard in it, as\\r\\nthere always is in the majority of military movements, and I cannot begin\\r\\nthe movement without giving you notice of it, particularly as I know so\\r\\nlittle of the effect that it may have upon other movements of distant\\r\\narmies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe influence of your telegram the other day is still upon me, and has\\r\\nimpressed me with the idea that there are many parts of the problem which\\r\\ninfluence you that are not known to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to relieve you from all embarrassment in my case, I inclose with\\r\\nthis my resignation of my commission as major-general of volunteers, which\\r\\nyou can have accepted if my movement is not in accordance with the views\\r\\nof yourself and your military advisers.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have taken the liberty to write to you personally upon this subject,\\r\\nbecause it was necessary, as I learned from General Halleck, for you to\\r\\napprove of my general plan, written at Warrenton, before I could commence\\r\\nthe movement; and I think it quite as necessary that you should know of\\r\\nthe important movement I am about to make, particularly as it will have to\\r\\nbe made in opposition to the views of nearly all my general officers, and\\r\\nafter the receipt of a despatch from you informing me of the opinion of\\r\\nsome of them who had visited you.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conversation with you on New Year\\'s morning I was led to express some\\r\\nopinions which I afterward felt it my duty to place on paper, and to\\r\\nexpress them verbally to the gentleman of whom we were speaking, which I\\r\\ndid in your presence, after handing you the letter. You were not disposed\\r\\nthen, as I saw, to retain the letter, and I took it back, but I now return\\r\\nit to you for record if you wish it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI beg leave to say that my resignation is not sent in in any spirit of\\r\\ninsubordination, but, as I before said, simply to relieve you from any\\r\\nembarrassment in changing commanders where lack of confidence may have\\r\\nrendered it necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bearer of this will bring me any answer, or I should be glad to hear\\r\\nfrom you by telegraph in cipher.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\\r\\n\\r\\nA. E. BURNSIDE,\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor-General, Commanding Army of the Potomac.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON, January 7, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Commanding, etc., Falmouth:\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL:--Your communication of the 5th was delivered to me by your\\r\\naide-de-camp at 12 M. to-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all my communications and interviews with you since you took command\\r\\nof the Army of the Potomac I have advised a forward movement across the\\r\\nRappahannock. At our interview at Warrenton I urged that you should cross\\r\\nby the fords above Fredericksburg rather than to fall down to that\\r\\nplace; and when I left you at Warrenton it was understood that at least\\r\\na considerable part of your army would cross by the fords, and I so\\r\\nrepresented to the President. It was this modification of the plan\\r\\nproposed by you that I telegraphed you had received his approval. When\\r\\nthe attempt at Fredericksburg was abandoned, I advised you to renew the\\r\\nattempt at some other point, either in whole or in part, to turn the\\r\\nenemy\\'s works, or to threaten their wings or communications; in other\\r\\nwords, to keep the enemy occupied till a favorable opportunity offered to\\r\\nstrike a decisive blow. I particularly advised you to use your cavalry\\r\\nand light artillery upon his communications, and attempt to cut off his\\r\\nsupplies and engage him at an advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all our interviews I have urged that our first object was, not\\r\\nRichmond, but the defeat or scattering of Lee\\'s army, which threatened\\r\\nWashington and the line of the upper Potomac. I now recur to these things\\r\\nsimply to remind you of the general views which I have expressed, and\\r\\nwhich I still hold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe circumstances of the case, however, have somewhat changed since the\\r\\nearly part of November. The chances of an extended line of operations\\r\\nare now, on account of the advanced season, much less than then. But\\r\\nthe chances are still in our favor to meet and defeat the enemy on the\\r\\nRappahannock, if we can effect a crossing in a position where we can meet\\r\\nthe enemy on favorable or even equal terms. I therefore still advise a\\r\\nmovement against him. The character of that movement, however, must depend\\r\\nupon circumstances which may change any day and almost any hour. If the\\r\\nenemy should concentrate his forces at the place you have selected for a\\r\\ncrossing, make it a feint and try another place. Again, the circumstances\\r\\nat the time may be such as to render an attempt to cross the entire\\r\\narmy not advisable. In that case, theory suggests that, while the enemy\\r\\nconcentrates at that point, advantages can be gained by crossing smaller\\r\\nforces at other points to cut off his lines, destroy his communication,\\r\\nand capture his rear-guards, outposts, etc. The great object is to occupy\\r\\nthe enemy to prevent his making large detachments or distant raids, and to\\r\\ninjure him all you can with the least injury to yourself. If this can\\r\\nbe best accomplished by feints of a general crossing and detached real\\r\\ncrossings, take that course; if by an actual general crossing, with feints\\r\\non other points, adopt that course. There seem to me to be many reasons\\r\\nwhy a crossing at some point should be attempted. It will not do to keep\\r\\nyour large army inactive. As you yourself admit, it devolves on you to\\r\\ndecide upon the time, place, and character of the crossing which you\\r\\nmay attempt. I can only advise that an attempt be made, and as early as\\r\\npossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\\r\\n\\r\\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Indorsement.]\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 8, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL BURNSIDE:\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand General Halleck has sent you a letter of which this is a\\r\\ncopy. I approve this letter. I deplore the want of concurrence with you\\r\\nin opinion by your general officers, but I do not see the remedy. Be\\r\\ncautious, and do not understand that the government or country is driving\\r\\nyou. I do not yet see how I could profit by changing the command of the\\r\\nArmy of the Potomac; and if I did, I should not wish to do it by accepting\\r\\nthe resignation of your commission.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. JANUARY 14, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: The Secretary of State has submitted to\\r\\nme a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 5th instant, which\\r\\nhas been delivered to him, and which is in the following words:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Resolved, That the Secretary of State be requested to communicate to this\\r\\nHouse, if not, in his judgment, incompatible with the public interest,\\r\\nwhy our Minister in New Granada has not presented his credentials to\\r\\nthe actual government of that country; also the reasons for which\\r\\nSenor Murillo is not recognized by the United States as the diplomatic\\r\\nrepresentative of the Mosquera government of that country; also,\\r\\nwhat negotiations have been had, if any, with General Herran as the\\r\\nrepresentative of Ospina\\'s government in New Granada since it went into\\r\\nexistence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 12th day of December, 1846, a treaty of amity, peace, and concord\\r\\nwas concluded between the United States of America and the Republic of\\r\\nNew Granada, which is still in force. On the 7th day of December, 1847,\\r\\nGeneral Pedro Alcantara Herran, who had been duly accredited, was received\\r\\nhere as the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of that,\\r\\nrepublic. On the 30th day of August, 1849, Senor Don Rafael Rivas was\\r\\nreceived by this government as charge d\\'affaires of the same republic. On\\r\\nthe 5th day of December, 1851, a consular convention was concluded between\\r\\nthat republic and the United States, which treaty was signed on behalf of\\r\\nthe Republic of Granada by the same Senor Rivas. This treaty is still in\\r\\nforce. On the 27th of April, 1852, Senor Don Victoriano de Diego Paredes\\r\\nwas received as charge d\\'affaires of the Republic of New Granada. On the\\r\\n20th of June, 1855, General Pedro Alcantara Herran was again received as\\r\\nenvoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, duly accredited by the\\r\\nRepublic of New Granada, and he has ever since remained, under the same\\r\\ncredentials, as the representative of that republic near the Government of\\r\\nthe United States. On the 10th of September, 1857, a claims convention\\r\\nwas concluded between the United States and the Republic of Granada. This\\r\\nconvention is still in force, and has in part been executed. In May, 1858,\\r\\nthe constitution of the republic was remodelled; and the nation assumed\\r\\nthe political title of \"The Granadian Confederacy.\" This fact was\\r\\nformally announced to this Government, but without any change in\\r\\ntheir representative here. Previously to the 4th day of March, 1861, a\\r\\nrevolutionary war against the Republic of New Granada, which had thus\\r\\nbeen recognized and treated with by the United States, broke out in New\\r\\nGranada, assuming to set up a new government under the name of \"United\\r\\nStates of Colombia.\" This war has had various vicissitudes, sometimes\\r\\nfavorable, sometimes adverse, to the revolutionary movements. The\\r\\nrevolutionary organization has hitherto been simply a military\\r\\nprovisionary power, and no definitive constitution of government has\\r\\nyet been established in New Granada in place of that organized by the\\r\\nconstitution of 1858. The minister of the United States to the Granadian\\r\\nConfederacy, who was appointed on the 29th day of May, 1861, was directed,\\r\\nin view of the occupation of the capital by the revolutionary party and of\\r\\nthe uncertainty of the civil war, not to present his credentials to either\\r\\nthe government of the Granadian Confederacy or to the provisional military\\r\\ngovernment, but to conduct his affairs informally, as is customary in such\\r\\ncases, and to report the progress of events and await the instructions of\\r\\nthis Government. The advices which have been received from him have not\\r\\nhitherto, been sufficiently conclusive to determine me to recognize the\\r\\nrevolutionary government. General Herran being here, with full authority\\r\\nfrom the Government of New Canada, which has been so long recognized\\r\\nby the United States, I have not received any representative from the\\r\\nrevolutionary government, which has not yet been recognized, because such\\r\\na proceeding would be in itself an act of recognition.\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficial communications have been had on various incidental and occasional\\r\\nquestions with General Herran as the minister plenipotentiary and envoy\\r\\nextraordinary of the Granadian Confederacy, but in no other character.

LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINTING MONEY\\r\\n\\r\\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 17, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\\r\\n\\r\\nI have signed the joint resolution to provide for the immediate payment\\r\\nof the army and navy of the United States, passed by the House of\\r\\nRepresentatives on the 14th and by the Senate on the 15th instant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe joint resolution is a simple authority, amounting, however, under\\r\\nexisting circumstances, to a direction, to the Secretary of the Treasury\\r\\nto make an additional issue of $100,000,000 in United States notes, if so\\r\\nmuch money is needed, for the payment of the army and navy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy approval is given in order that every possible facility may be afforded\\r\\nfor the prompt discharge of all arrears of pay due to our soldiers and our\\r\\nsailors.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile giving this approval, however, I think it my duty to express my\\r\\nsincere regret that it has been found necessary to authorize so large an\\r\\nadditional issue of United States notes, when this circulation and that\\r\\nof the suspended banks together have become already so redundant as to\\r\\nincrease prices beyond real values, thereby augmenting the cost of living\\r\\nto the injury of labor, and the cost of supplies to the injury of the\\r\\nwhole country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems very plain that continued issues of United States notes without\\r\\nany check to the issues of suspended banks, and without adequate provision\\r\\nfor the raising of money by loans and for funding the issues so as to keep\\r\\nthem within due limits, must soon produce disastrous consequences; and\\r\\nthis matter appears to me so important that I feel bound to avail myself\\r\\nof this occasion to ask the special attention of Congress to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Congress has power to regulate the currency of the country can hardly\\r\\nadmit of doubt, and that a judicious measure to prevent the deterioration\\r\\nof this currency, by a seasonable taxation of bank circulation or\\r\\notherwise, is needed seems equally clear. Independently of this general\\r\\nconsideration, it would be unjust to the people at large to exempt banks\\r\\nenjoying the special privilege of circulation from their just proportion\\r\\nof the public burdens.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to raise money by way of loans most easily and cheaply, it is\\r\\nclearly necessary to give every possible support to the public credit. To\\r\\nthat end a uniform currency, in which taxes, subscriptions to loans, and\\r\\nall other ordinary public dues as well as all private dues may be paid,\\r\\nis almost if not quite indispensable. Such a currency can be furnished\\r\\nby banking associations organized under a general act of Congress, as\\r\\nsuggested in my message at the beginning of the present session. The\\r\\nsecuring of this circulation by the pledge of United States bonds, as\\r\\ntherein suggested, would still further facilitate loans, by increasing the\\r\\npresent and causing a future demand for such bonds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn view of the actual financial embarrassments of the government, and of\\r\\nthe greater embarrassment sure to come if the necessary means of relief\\r\\nbe not afforded, I feel that I should not perform my duty by a simple\\r\\nannouncement of my approval of the joint resolution, which proposes relief\\r\\nonly by increased circulation, without expressing my earnest desire that\\r\\nmeasures such in substance as those I have just referred to may receive\\r\\nthe early sanction of Congress. By such measures, in my opinion, will\\r\\npayment be most certainly secured, not only to the army and navy, but to\\r\\nall honest creditors of the government, and satisfactory provision made\\r\\nfor future demands on the treasury.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE WORKING-MEN OF MANCHESTER, ENGLAND.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE WORKING-MEN OF MANCHESTER:\\r\\n\\r\\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the address and resolutions\\r\\nwhich you sent me on the eve of the new year. When I came, on the 4th of\\r\\nMarch, 1861, through a free and constitutional election to fireside in\\r\\nthe Government of the United States, the country was found at the verge of\\r\\ncivil war. Whatever might have been the cause, or whosesoever the fault,\\r\\none duty, paramount to all others, was before me, namely, to maintain\\r\\nand preserve at once the Constitution and the integrity of the Federal\\r\\nRepublic. A conscientious purpose to perform this duty is the key to\\r\\nall the measures of administration which have been and to all which will\\r\\nhereafter be pursued. Under our frame of government and my official oath,\\r\\nI could not depart from this purpose if I would. It is not always in the\\r\\npower of governments to enlarge or restrict the scope of moral results\\r\\nwhich follow the policies that they may deem it necessary for the public\\r\\nsafety from time to time to adopt.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have understood well that the duty of self-preservation rests solely\\r\\nwith the American people; but I have at the same time been aware that\\r\\nfavor or disfavor of foreign nations might have a material influence\\r\\nin enlarging or prolonging the struggle with disloyal men in which the\\r\\ncountry is engaged. A fair examination of history has served to authorize\\r\\na belief that the past actions and influences of the United States were\\r\\ngenerally regarded as having been beneficial toward mankind. I have,\\r\\ntherefore, reckoned upon the forbearance of nations. Circumstances--to\\r\\nsome of which you kindly allude--induce me especially to expect that if\\r\\njustice and good faith should be practised by the United States, they\\r\\nwould encounter no hostile influence on the part of Great Britain. It is\\r\\nnow a pleasant duty to acknowledge the demonstration you have given of\\r\\nyour desire that a spirit of amity and peace toward this country may\\r\\nprevail in the councils of your Queen, who is respected and esteemed in\\r\\nyour own country only more than she is by the kindred nation which has its\\r\\nhome on this side of the Atlantic.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know and deeply deplore the sufferings which the workingmen at\\r\\nManchester, and in all Europe, are called to endure in this crisis. It has\\r\\nbeen often and studiously represented that the attempt to overthrow this\\r\\ngovernment, which was built upon the foundation of human rights, and to\\r\\nsubstitute for it one which should rest exclusively on the basis of human\\r\\nslavery, was likely to obtain the favor of Europe. Through the action of\\r\\nour disloyal citizens, the working-men of Europe have been subjected to\\r\\nsevere trials, for the purpose of forcing their sanction to that attempt.\\r\\nUnder the circumstance, I cannot but regard your decisive utterances upon\\r\\nthe question as an instance of sublime Christian heroism which has not\\r\\nbeen surpassed in any age or in any country. It is indeed an energetic and\\r\\ninspiring assurance of the inherent power of truth and of the ultimate and\\r\\nuniversal triumph of justice, humanity, and freedom. I do not doubt that\\r\\nthe sentiments, you have expressed will be sustained by your great nation;\\r\\nand, on the other hand, I have no hesitation in assuring you that they\\r\\nwill excite admiration, esteem, and the most reciprocal feelings of\\r\\nfriendship among the American people.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hail this interchange of sentiment, therefore, as an augury that\\r\\nwhatever else may happen, whatever misfortune may befall your country or\\r\\nmy own, the peace and friendship which now exist between the two nations\\r\\nwill be, as it shall be my desire to make them, perpetual.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, January 21, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\\r\\n\\r\\nI submit herewith for your consideration the joint resolutions of the\\r\\ncorporate authorities of the city of Washington, adopted September a 7,\\r\\n1862, and a memorial of the same under date of October 28, 1862, both\\r\\nrelating to and urging the construction of certain railroads concentrating\\r\\nupon the city of Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn presenting this memorial and the joint resolutions to you, I am not\\r\\nprepared to say more than that the subject is one of great practical\\r\\nimportance, and that I hope it will receive the attention of Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

GRANT.\\r\\n\\r\\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 21, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL GRANT, Memphis.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL:--The President has directed that so much of Arkansas as you may\\r\\ndesire to control be temporarily attached to your department. This will\\r\\ngive you control of both banks of the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn your operations down the Mississippi you must not rely too confidently\\r\\nupon any direct co-operation of General Banks and the lower flotilla, as\\r\\nit is possible that they may not be able to pass or reduce Port Hudson.\\r\\nThey, however, will do everything in their power to form a junction with\\r\\nyou at Vicksburg. If they should not be able to effect this, they will\\r\\nat least occupy a portion of the enemy\\'s forces, and prevent them from\\r\\nreinforcing Vicksburg. I hope, however, that they will do still better and\\r\\nbe able to join you.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be proper to give you some explanation of the revocation of your\\r\\norder expelling all Jews from your department. The President has no\\r\\nobjection to your expelling traitors and Jew peddlers, which, I suppose,\\r\\nwas the object of your order; but as it in terms proscribed an entire\\r\\nreligious class, some of whom are fighting in our ranks, the President\\r\\ndeemed it necessary to revoke it.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\\r\\n\\r\\nH.

The President of the United States has directed:\\r\\n\\r\\n1st. That Major-General A. E. Burnside, at his own request, be relieved\\r\\nfrom the command of the Army of the Potomac.\\r\\n\\r\\n2d. That Major-General E. V. Sumner, at his own request, be relieved from\\r\\nduty in the Army of the Potomac.\\r\\n\\r\\n3d. That Major-General W. B.

The officers relieved as above will report in person to the\\r\\nadjutant-general of the army.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy order of the Secretary of War: D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL J. HOOKER.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., January 26, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL:--I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. Of\\r\\ncourse I have done this upon what appear to me to be sufficient reasons,\\r\\nand yet I think it best for you to know that there are some things in\\r\\nregard to which I am not quite satisfied with you. I believe you to be a\\r\\nbrave and skillful soldier, which of course I like. I also believe you do\\r\\nnot mix politics with your profession, in which you are right. You have\\r\\nconfidence in yourself, which is a valuable if not an indispensable\\r\\nquality. You are ambitious, which within reasonable bounds does good\\r\\nrather than harm; but I think that during General Burnside\\'s command of\\r\\nthe army you have taken counsel of your ambition and thwarted him as much\\r\\nas you could, in which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most\\r\\nmeritorious and honorable brother officer. I have heard, in such a way\\r\\nas to believe it, of your recently saying that both the army and the\\r\\ngovernment needed a dictator. Of course it was not for this, but in spite\\r\\nof it, that I have given you the command. Only those generals who gain\\r\\nsuccesses can set up dictators. What I now ask of you is military success,\\r\\nand I will risk the dictatorship. The government will support you to the\\r\\nutmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less than it has done\\r\\nand will do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit that you\\r\\nhave aided to infuse into the army, of criticizing their commander and\\r\\nwithholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist\\r\\nyou as far as I can to put it down. Neither you nor Napoleon, if he\\r\\nwere alive again, could get any good out of an army while such a spirit\\r\\nprevails in it. And now beware of rashness. Beware of rashness, but with\\r\\nenergy and sleepless vigilance go forward and give us victories.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

For his omission\\r\\nto perform his whole duty on that occasion, and the injury thereby\\r\\ninflicted on the service and the country, his name was stricken from the\\r\\nlist of naval officers and he was dismissed [from] the service.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince his dismissal earnest application has been made for his restoration\\r\\nto his former position by senators and naval officers, on the ground that\\r\\nhis fault was an error of judgment, and that the example in his case has\\r\\nalready had its effect in preventing a repetition of similar neglect.\\r\\n\\r\\nI therefore on this application and representation, and in consideration\\r\\nof his previous fair record, do hereby nominate George Henry Preble to\\r\\nbe a commander in the navy from the 16th July, 1862, to take rank on the\\r\\nactive list next after Commander Edward Donaldson, and to fill a vacancy\\r\\noccasioned by the death of Commander J.

States Navy,\\r\\nwas dismissed from the service under a misapprehension in regard to his\\r\\nloyalty to the Government, from the circumstance that several oaths\\r\\nwere transmitted to him and the Navy Department failed to receive any\\r\\nrecognition of them. After his dismissal, and upon his assurance that\\r\\nthe oath failed to reach him and his readiness to execute it, he was\\r\\nrecommissioned to his original position on the 4th September following.\\r\\nOn the same day, 4th September, he was ordered to command the sloop of war\\r\\nVandalia; on the 22d this order was revoked and he was ordered to duty in\\r\\nthe Mississippi Squadron, and on the 23d January, 1862, was detached sick,\\r\\nand has since remained unemployed. The advisory board under the act of\\r\\n16th July, 1862, did not recommend him for further promotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis last commission, having been issued during the recess of the Senate,\\r\\nexpired at the end of the succeeding session, 17th July, 1862, from which\\r\\ndate, not having been nominated to the Senate, he ceased to be a commander\\r\\nin the navy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo correct the omission to nominate this officer to the Senate at its last\\r\\nsession, I now nominate Commander Roger Perry to be a commander in the\\r\\nnavy from the 14th September, 1855, to take his relative position on the\\r\\nlist of commanders not recommended for further promotion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

ANDREW JOHNSON.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am told you have at least thought of raising a negro\\r\\nmilitary force. In my opinion the country now needs no specific thing so\\r\\nmuch as some man of your ability and position to go to this work. When I\\r\\nspeak of your position, I mean that of an eminent citizen of a slave State\\r\\nand himself a slaveholder. The colored population is the great available\\r\\nand yet unavailed of force for restoring the Union. The bare sight of\\r\\nfifty thousand armed and drilled black soldiers upon the banks of the\\r\\nMississippi would end the rebellion at once; and who doubts that we\\r\\ncan present that sight if we but take hold in earnest? If you have been\\r\\nthinking of it, please do not dismiss the thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPROCLAMATION APPOINTING A NATIONAL FAST-DAY.\\r\\n\\r\\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\\r\\n\\r\\nA Proclamation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 30, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereas the Senate of the United States, devoutly recognizing the supreme\\r\\nauthority and just government of Almighty God in all the affairs of men\\r\\nand of nations, has by a resolution requested the President to designate\\r\\nand set apart a day for national prayer and humiliation:\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd whereas it is the duty of nations as well as men to own their\\r\\ndependence upon the overruling power of God; to confess their sins and\\r\\ntransgressions in humble sorrow, yet with assured hope that genuine\\r\\nrepentance will lead to mercy and pardon; and to recognize the sublime\\r\\ntruth, announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that\\r\\nthose nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord:\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd insomuch as we know that by His divine law nations, like individuals,\\r\\nare subjected to punishments and chastisements in this world, may we not\\r\\njustly fear that the awful calamity of civil war which now desolates the\\r\\nland may be but a punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous sins,\\r\\nto the needful end of our national reformation as a whole people? We\\r\\nhave been the recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven. We have been\\r\\npreserved, these many years, in peace and prosperity. We have grown in\\r\\nnumbers, wealth, and power as no other nation has ever grown; but we have\\r\\nforgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in\\r\\npeace, and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us; and we have vainly\\r\\nimagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings\\r\\nwere produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated\\r\\nwith unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the\\r\\nnecessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God\\r\\nthat made us:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt behooves us, then, to humble ourselves before the offended Power, to\\r\\nconfess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and forgiveness:\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, therefore, in compliance with the request, and fully concurring in\\r\\nthe views, of the Senate, I do by this my proclamation designate and\\r\\nset apart Thursday, the 30th day of April, 1863, as a day of national\\r\\nhumiliation, fasting, and prayer. And I do hereby request all the people\\r\\nto abstain on that day from their ordinary secular pursuits, and to unite\\r\\nat their several places of public worship and their respective homes in\\r\\nkeeping the day holy to the Lord, and devoted to the humble discharge of\\r\\nthe religious duties proper to that solemn occasion. All this being done\\r\\nin sincerity and truth, let us then rest humbly in the hope, authorized by\\r\\nthe divine teachings, that the united cry of the nation will be heard on\\r\\nhigh, and answered with blessings no less than the pardon of our national\\r\\nsins, and the restoration of our now divided and suffering country to its\\r\\nformer happy condition of unity and peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\\r\\nthe United States to be affixed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDone at the city of Washington, this thirtieth day of March, in the\\r\\nyear of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the\\r\\nindependence of the United States the eighty-seventh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

It is a steam ram, built so\\r\\nas to sacrifice nearly all capacity for carrying to those of speed and\\r\\nstrength, so as to be able to split any vessel having hollow enough in her\\r\\nto carry supplies for a voyage of any distance. Such ram, of course, could\\r\\nnot herself carry supplies for a voyage of considerable distance, and her\\r\\nbusiness would be to guard a particular harbor as a bulldog guards his\\r\\nmaster\\'s door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\\r\\n\\r\\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY POTOMAC, April 9, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE NAVY:\\r\\n\\r\\nRichmond Whig of the 8th has no telegraphic despatches from Charleston,\\r\\nbut has the following as editorial:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All thoughts are now centred upon Charleston. Official intelligence was\\r\\nmade public early yesterday morning that the enemy\\'s iron-clad fleet\\r\\nhad attempted to cross the bar and failed, but later in the day it was\\r\\nannounced that the gunboats and transports had succeeded in crossing and\\r\\nwere at anchor. Our iron-clads lay between the forts quietly awaiting the\\r\\nattack. Further intelligence is looked for with eager anxiety. The Yankees\\r\\nhave made no secret of this vast preparation for an attack on Charleston,\\r\\nand we may well anticipate a desperate conflict. At last the hour of trial\\r\\nhas come for Charleston, the hour of deliverance or destruction, for no\\r\\none believes the other alternative, surrender, possible. The heart of the\\r\\nwhole country yearns toward the beleaguered city with intense solicitude,\\r\\nyet with hopes amounting to confidence. Charleston knows what is expected\\r\\nof her, and which is due to her fame, and to the relation she sustains to\\r\\nthe cause. The devoted, the heroic, the great-hearted Beauregard is there,\\r\\nand he, too, knows what is expected of him and will not disappoint that\\r\\nexpectation. We predict a Saragossa defense, and that if Charleston is\\r\\ntaken it will be only a heap of ruins.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rebel pickets are reported as calling over to our pickets today that\\r\\nwe had taken some rebel fort. This is not very intelligible, and I think\\r\\nis entirely unreliable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

No censure upon you, or\\r\\neither of you, is intended. We still hope that by cordial and judicious\\r\\nco-operation you can take the batteries on Morris Island and Sullivan\\'s\\r\\nIsland and Fort Sumter. But whether you can or not, we wish the\\r\\ndemonstration kept up for a time, for a collateral and very important\\r\\nobject. We wish the attempt to be a real one, though not a desperate one,\\r\\nif it affords any considerable chance of success. But if prosecuted as a\\r\\ndemonstration only, this must not become public, or the whole effect will\\r\\nbe lost. Once again before Charleston, do not leave until further orders\\r\\nfrom here.

CURTIN, Harrisburg, Penn.:\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not think the people of Pennsylvania should be uneasy about an\\r\\ninvasion. Doubtless a small force of the enemy is flourishing about in\\r\\nthe northern part of Virginia, on the \"skewhorn\" principle, on purpose to\\r\\ndivert us in another quarter. I believe it is nothing more. We think we\\r\\nhave adequate force close after them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO W. A.

The worst thing the\\r\\nenemy could do for himself would be to weaken himself before Hooker, and\\r\\ntherefore it is safe to believe he is not doing it; and the best thing\\r\\nhe could do for himself would be to get us so scared as to bring part\\r\\nof Hooker\\'s force away, and that is just what he is trying to do. I will\\r\\ntelegraph you in the morning about calling out the militia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

I hope I am not\\r\\nless anxious to do my duty to Pennsylvania than yourself, but I really\\r\\ndo not yet see the justification for incurring the trouble and expense of\\r\\ncalling out the militia.

If possible, I would be very glad of another\\r\\nmovement early enough to give us some benefit from the fact of the enemy\\'s\\r\\ncommunication being broken; but neither for this reason nor any other do\\r\\nI wish anything done in desperation or rashness.

General Willich, an exchanged prisoner just from\\r\\nRichmond, has talked with me this morning. He was there when our cavalry\\r\\ncut the roads in that vicinity. He says there was not a sound pair of legs\\r\\nin Richmond, and that our men, had they known it, could have safely\\r\\ngone in and burned everything and brought in Jeff Davis. We captured and\\r\\nparoled 300 or 400 men. He says as he came to City Point there was an army\\r\\nthree miles long (Longstreet\\'s, he thought) moving toward Richmond.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuroy has captured a despatch of General Lee, in which he says his loss\\r\\nwas fearful in his last battle with you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

May 14, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER, Commanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--When I wrote on the 7th, I had an impression that possibly\\r\\nby an early movement you could get some advantage from the supposed facts\\r\\nthat the enemy\\'s communications were disturbed and that he was somewhat\\r\\nderanged in position. That idea has now passed away, the enemy having\\r\\nre-established his communications, regained his positions, and actually\\r\\nreceived reinforcements. It does not now appear probable to me that\\r\\nyou can gain anything by an early renewal of the attempt to cross the\\r\\nRappahannock. I therefore shall not complain if you do no more for a time\\r\\nthan to keep the enemy at bay and out of other mischief by menaces and\\r\\noccasional cavalry raids, if practicable, and to put your own army in good\\r\\ncondition again. Still, if in your own clear judgment you can renew the\\r\\nattack successfully, I do not mean to restrain you. Bearing upon this last\\r\\npoint, I must tell you that I have some painful intimations that some\\r\\nof your corps and division commanders are not giving you their entire\\r\\nconfidence. This would be ruinous, if true, and you should therefore,\\r\\nfirst of all, ascertain the real facts beyond all possibility of doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

SCHOFIELD.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--Having relieved General Curtis and assigned you to the\\r\\ncommand of the Department of the Missouri, I think it may be of some\\r\\nadvantage for me to state why I did it. I did not relieve General Curtis\\r\\nbecause of any full conviction that he had done wrong by commission or\\r\\nomission. I did it because of a conviction in my mind that the Union\\r\\nmen of Missouri, constituting, when united, a vast majority of the\\r\\nwhole people, have entered into a pestilent factional quarrel among\\r\\nthemselves--General Curtis, perhaps not of choice, being the head of one\\r\\nfaction and Governor Gamble that of the other. After months of labor to\\r\\nreconcile the difficulty, it seemed to grow worse and worse, until I felt\\r\\nit my duty to break it up somehow; and as I could not remove Governor\\r\\nGamble, I had to remove General Curtis. Now that you are in the position,\\r\\nI wish you to undo nothing merely because General Curtis or Governor\\r\\nGamble did it, but to exercise your own judgment, and do right for the\\r\\npublic interest. Let your military measures be strong enough to repel the\\r\\ninvader and keep the peace, and not so strong as to unnecessarily harass\\r\\nand persecute the people. It is a difficult role, and so much greater will\\r\\nbe the honor if you perform it well. If both factions, or neither, shall\\r\\nabuse you, you will probably be about right. Beware of being assailed by\\r\\none and praised by the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

Neither do they mention any demand made by Grant\\r\\nupon Pemberton for a surrender. They speak of our troops as being in good\\r\\nhealth, condition, and spirits.

So much of professional military\\r\\nskill is requisite to answer it that I have turned the task over to\\r\\nGeneral Halleck. He promises to perform it with his utmost care. I have\\r\\nbut one idea which I think worth suggesting to you, and that is, in case\\r\\nyou find Lee coming to the north of the Rappahannock, I would by no\\r\\nmeans cross to the south of it. If he should leave a rear force\\r\\nat Fredericksburg, tempting you to fall upon it, it would fight in\\r\\nentrenchments and have you at advantage, and so, man for man, worst you at\\r\\nthat point, While his main force would in some way be getting an advantage\\r\\nof you northward. In one word, I would not take any risk of being\\r\\nentangled up on the river like an ox jumped half over a fence and liable\\r\\nto be torn by dogs front and rear without a fair chance to gore one way or\\r\\nto kick the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Lee would come to my side of the river I would keep on the same side\\r\\nand fight him, or act on the defensive, according as might be my estimate\\r\\nof his strength relatively to my own. But these are mere suggestions,\\r\\nwhich I desire to be controlled by the judgment of yourself and General\\r\\nHalleck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO MRS.

LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO ERASTUS CORNING AND OTHERS.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 12, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. ERASTUS CORNING AND OTHERS.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEMEN:--Your letter of May 19, inclosing the resolutions of a public\\r\\nmeeting held at Albany, New York, on the 16th of the same month, was\\r\\nreceived several days ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resolutions, as I understand them, are resolvable into two\\r\\npropositions--first, the expression of a purpose to sustain the cause\\r\\nof the Union, to secure peace through victory, and to support the\\r\\nadministration in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the\\r\\nrebellion; and, secondly, a declaration of censure upon the administration\\r\\nfor supposed unconstitutional action, such as the making of military\\r\\narrests. And from the two propositions a third is deduced, which is that\\r\\nthe gentlemen composing the meeting are resolved on doing their part\\r\\nto maintain our common government and country, despite the folly or\\r\\nwickedness, as they may conceive, of any administration. This position is\\r\\neminently patriotic, and as such I thank the meeting, and congratulate the\\r\\nnation for it. My own purpose is the same; so that the meeting and myself\\r\\nhave a common object, and can have no difference, except in the choice of\\r\\nmeans or measures for effecting that object.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here I ought to close this paper, and would close it, if there were no\\r\\napprehension that more injurious consequences than any merely personal\\r\\nto myself might follow the censures systematically cast upon me for doing\\r\\nwhat, in my view of duty, I could not forbear. The resolutions promise\\r\\nto support me in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the\\r\\nrebellion; and I have not knowingly employed, nor shall knowingly employ,\\r\\nany other. But the meeting, by their resolutions, assert and argue that\\r\\ncertain military arrests, and proceedings following them, for which I am\\r\\nultimately responsible, are unconstitutional. I think they are not. The\\r\\nresolutions quote from the Constitution the definition of treason, and\\r\\nalso the limiting safeguards and guarantees therein provided for the\\r\\ncitizen on trial for treason, and on his being held to answer for capital\\r\\nor otherwise infamous crimes, and in criminal prosecutions his right to\\r\\na speedy and public trial by an impartial jury. They proceed to\\r\\nresolve \"that these safeguards of the rights of the citizen against the\\r\\npretensions of arbitrary power were intended more especially for his\\r\\nprotection in times of civil commotion.\" And, apparently to demonstrate\\r\\nthe proposition, the resolutions proceed: \"They were secured substantially\\r\\nto the English people after years of protracted civil war, and were\\r\\nadopted into our Constitution at the close of the Revolution.\" Would not\\r\\nthe demonstration have been better if it could have been truly said that\\r\\nthese safeguards had been adopted and applied during the civil wars and\\r\\nduring our Revolution, instead of after the one and at the close of the\\r\\nother? I too am devotedly for them after civil war, and before Civil war,\\r\\nand at all times, \"except when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the\\r\\npublic safety may require\" their suspension. The resolutions proceed to\\r\\ntell us that these safeguards \"have stood the test of seventy-six years\\r\\nof trial under our republican system, under circumstances which show that,\\r\\nwhile they constitute the foundation of all free government, they are the\\r\\nelements of the enduring stability of the republic.\" No one denies that\\r\\nthey have so stood the test up to the beginning of the present rebellion,\\r\\nif we except a certain occurrence at New Orleans hereafter to be\\r\\nmentioned; nor does any one question that they will stand the same test\\r\\nmuch longer after the rebellion closes. But these provisions of the\\r\\nConstitution have no application to the case we have in hand, because\\r\\nthe arrests complained of were not made for treason--that is, not for the\\r\\ntreason defined in the Constitution, and upon the conviction of which the\\r\\npunishment is death--nor yet were they made to hold persons to answer\\r\\nfor any capital or otherwise infamous crimes; nor were the proceedings\\r\\nfollowing, in any constitutional or legal sense, \"criminal prosecutions.\"\\r\\nThe arrests were made on totally different grounds, and the proceedings\\r\\nfollowing accorded with the grounds of the arrests. Let us consider the\\r\\nreal case with which we are dealing, and apply to it the parts of the\\r\\nConstitution plainly made for such cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to my installation here it had been inculcated that any State had\\r\\na lawful right to secede from the national Union, and that it would be\\r\\nexpedient to exercise the right whenever the devotees of the doctrine\\r\\nshould fail to elect a president to their own liking. I was elected\\r\\ncontrary to their liking; and accordingly, so far as it was legally\\r\\npossible, they had taken seven States out of the Union, had seized many\\r\\nof the United States forts, and had fired upon the United States flag, all\\r\\nbefore I was inaugurated, and, of course, before I had done any official\\r\\nact whatever. The rebellion thus begun soon ran into the present civil\\r\\nwar; and, in certain respects, it began on very unequal terms between the\\r\\nparties. The insurgents had been preparing for it more than thirty years,\\r\\nwhile the government had taken no steps to resist them. The former had\\r\\ncarefully considered all the means which could be turned to their account.\\r\\nIt undoubtedly was a well-pondered reliance with them that in their own\\r\\nunrestricted effort to destroy Union, Constitution and law, all together,\\r\\nthe government would, in great degree, be restrained by the same\\r\\nConstitution and law from arresting their progress. Their sympathizers\\r\\ninvaded all departments of the government and nearly all communities\\r\\nof the people. From this material, under cover of \"liberty of speech,\"\\r\\n\"liberty of the press,\" and \"habeas corpus,\" they hoped to keep on foot\\r\\namongst us a most efficient corps of spies, informers, suppliers, and\\r\\naiders and abettors of their cause in a thousand ways. They knew that\\r\\nin times such as they were inaugurating, by the Constitution itself the\\r\\n\"habeas corpus\" might be suspended; but they also knew they had friends\\r\\nwho would make a question as to who was to suspend it; meanwhile their\\r\\nspies and others might remain at large to help on their cause. Or if, as\\r\\nhas happened, the Executive should suspend the writ without ruinous waste\\r\\nof time, instances of arresting innocent persons might occur, as are\\r\\nalways likely to occur in such cases; and then a clamor could be raised in\\r\\nregard to this, which might be at least of some service to the insurgent\\r\\ncause. It needed no very keen perception to discover this part of the\\r\\nenemies program, so soon as by open hostilities their machinery was fairly\\r\\nput in motion. Yet, thoroughly imbued with a reverence for the guaranteed\\r\\nrights of individuals, I was slow to adopt the strong measures which by\\r\\ndegrees I have been forced to regard as being within the exceptions of the\\r\\nConstitution, and as indispensable to the public safety. Nothing is better\\r\\nknown to history than that courts of justice are utterly incompetent to\\r\\nsuch cases. Civil courts are organized chiefly for trials of\\r\\nindividuals--or, at most, a few individuals acting in concert, and this in\\r\\nquiet times, and on charges of crimes well defined in the law. Even in\\r\\ntimes of peace bands of horse-thieves and robbers frequently grow too\\r\\nnumerous and powerful for the ordinary courts of justice. But what\\r\\ncomparison, in numbers have such bands ever borne to the insurgent\\r\\nsympathizers even in many of the loyal States? Again, a jury too\\r\\nfrequently has at least one member more ready to hang the panel than to\\r\\nhang the traitor. And yet again, he who dissuades one man from\\r\\nvolunteering, or induces one soldier to desert, weakens the Union cause as\\r\\nmuch as he who kills a Union soldier in battle. Yet this dissuasion or\\r\\ninducement may be so conducted as to be no defined crime of which any\\r\\ncivil court would take cognizance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOurs is a case of rebellion--so called by the resolutions before me--in\\r\\nfact, a clear, flagrant, and gigantic case of rebellion; and the provision\\r\\nof the Constitution that \"the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus\\r\\nshall not be suspended unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the\\r\\npublic safety may require it,\" is the provision which specially applies\\r\\nto our present case. This provision plainly attests the understanding\\r\\nof those who made the Constitution that ordinary courts of justice are\\r\\ninadequate to \"cases of rebellion\"--attests their purpose that, in such\\r\\ncases, men may be held in custody whom the courts, acting on ordinary\\r\\nrules, would discharge. Habeas corpus does not discharge men who are\\r\\nproved to be guilty of defined crime, and its suspension is allowed by the\\r\\nConstitution on purpose that men may be arrested and held who can not\\r\\nbe proved to be guilty of defined crime, \"when, in cases of rebellion or\\r\\ninvasion, the public safety may require it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is precisely our present case--a case of rebellion wherein the public\\r\\nsafety does require the suspension--Indeed, arrests by process of courts\\r\\nand arrests in cases of rebellion do not proceed altogether upon the same\\r\\nbasis. The former is directed at the small percentage of ordinary and\\r\\ncontinuous perpetration of crime, while the latter is directed at sudden\\r\\nand extensive uprisings against the government, which, at most, will\\r\\nsucceed or fail in no great length of time. In the latter case arrests\\r\\nare made not so much for what has been done as for what probably would be\\r\\ndone. The latter is more for the preventive and less for the vindictive\\r\\nthan the former. In such cases the purposes of men are much more easily\\r\\nunderstood than in cases of ordinary crime. The man who stands by and\\r\\nsays nothing when the peril of his government is discussed, cannot be\\r\\nmisunderstood. If not hindered, he is sure to help the enemy; much more\\r\\nif he talks ambiguously--talks for his country with \"buts,\" and \"ifs,\"\\r\\nand \"ands.\" Of how little value the constitutional provision I have quoted\\r\\nwill be rendered if arrests shall never be made until defined crimes shall\\r\\nhave been committed, may be illustrated by a few notable examples: General\\r\\nJohn C. Breckinridge, General Robert E. Lee, General Joseph E. Johnston,\\r\\nGeneral John B. Magruder, General William B. Preston, General Simon B.\\r\\nBuckner, and Commodore Franklin Buchanan, now occupying the very highest\\r\\nplaces in the rebel war service, were all within the power of the\\r\\ngovernment since the rebellion began, and were nearly as well known to\\r\\nbe traitors then as now. Unquestionably if we had seized and had them\\r\\nthe insurgent cause would be much weaker. But no one of them had then\\r\\ncommitted any crime defined in the law. Every one of them, if arrested,\\r\\nwould have been discharged on habeas corpus were the writ allowed to\\r\\noperate. In view of these and similar cases, I think the time not unlikely\\r\\nto come when I shall be blamed for having made too few arrests rather than\\r\\ntoo many.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the third resolution the meeting indicate their opinion that military\\r\\narrests may be constitutional in localities where rebellion actually\\r\\nexists, but that such arrests are unconstitutional in localities where\\r\\nrebellion or insurrection does not actually exist. They insist that such\\r\\narrests shall not be made \"outside of the lines of necessary military\\r\\noccupation and the scenes of insurrection.\" Inasmuch, however, as the\\r\\nConstitution itself makes no such distinction, I am unable to believe that\\r\\nthere is any such constitutional distinction. I concede that the class\\r\\nof arrests complained of can be constitutional only when, in cases of\\r\\nrebellion or invasion, the public safety may require them; and I insist\\r\\nthat in such cases--they are constitutional wherever the public safety\\r\\ndoes require them, as well in places to which they may prevent the\\r\\nrebellion extending, as in those where it may be already prevailing; as\\r\\nwell where they may restrain mischievous interference with the raising and\\r\\nsupplying of armies to suppress the rebellion as where the rebellion may\\r\\nactually be; as well where they may restrain the enticing men out of\\r\\nthe army as where they would prevent mutiny in the army; equally\\r\\nconstitutional at all places where they will conduce to the public safety\\r\\nas against the dangers of rebellion or invasion. Take the particular\\r\\ncase mentioned by the meeting. It is asserted in substance that Mr.\\r\\nVallandigham was, by a military commander, seized and tried \"for no other\\r\\nreason than words addressed to a public meeting in criticism of the course\\r\\nof the administration, and in condemnation of the military orders of the\\r\\ngeneral.\" Now, if there be no mistake about this, if this assertion is the\\r\\ntruth, and the whole truth, if there were no other reason for the arrest,\\r\\nthen I concede that the arrest was wrong. But the arrest, as I understand,\\r\\nwas made for a very different reason. Mr. Vallandigham avows his hostility\\r\\nto the war on the part of the Union; and his arrest was made because\\r\\nhe was laboring, with some effect, to prevent the raising of troops, to\\r\\nencourage desertions from the army, and to leave the rebellion without an\\r\\nadequate military force to suppress it. He was not arrested because he\\r\\nwas damaging the political prospects of the administration or the personal\\r\\ninterests of the commanding general, but because he was damaging the army,\\r\\nupon the existence and vigor of which the life of the nation depends. He\\r\\nwas warring upon the military, and thus gave the military constitutional\\r\\njurisdiction to lay hands upon him. If Mr. Vallandigham was not damaging\\r\\nthe military power of the country, then his arrest was made on mistake\\r\\nof fact, which I would be glad to correct on reasonably satisfactory\\r\\nevidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand the meeting whose resolutions I am considering to be in favor\\r\\nof suppressing the rebellion by military force--by armies. Long experience\\r\\nhas shown that armies cannot be maintained unless desertion shall be\\r\\npunished by the severe penalty of death. The case requires, and the law\\r\\nand the Constitution sanction, this punishment. Must I shoot a\\r\\nsimple-minded boy and not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induced him\\r\\nto desert. This is none the less injurious when effected by getting a\\r\\nfather, or brother, or friend into a public meeting, and there working\\r\\nupon his feelings till he is persuaded to write the soldier boy that he is\\r\\nfighting in a bad cause, for a wicked administration of a contemptible\\r\\ngovernment, too weak to arrest and punish him if he shall desert. I think\\r\\nthat, in such a case, to silence the agitator and save the boy is not only\\r\\nconstitutional, but withal a great mercy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I be wrong on this question of constitutional power, my error lies in\\r\\nbelieving that certain proceedings are constitutional when, in cases of\\r\\nrebellion or invasion, the public safety requires them, which would not\\r\\nbe constitutional when, in absence of rebellion or invasion, the public\\r\\nsafety does not require them: in other words, that the Constitution is\\r\\nnot in its application in all respects the same in cases of rebellion or\\r\\ninvasion involving the public safety as it is in times of profound peace\\r\\nand public security. The Constitution itself makes the distinction, and I\\r\\ncan no more be persuaded that the government can constitutionally take\\r\\nno strong measures in time of rebellion, because it can be shown that\\r\\nthe same could not be lawfully taken in times of peace, than I can be\\r\\npersuaded that a particular drug is not good medicine for a sick man\\r\\nbecause it can be shown to not be good food for a well one. Nor am I able\\r\\nto appreciate the danger apprehended by the meeting, that the American\\r\\npeople will by means of military arrests during the rebellion lose the\\r\\nright of public discussion, the liberty of speech and the press, the law\\r\\nof evidence, trial by jury, and habeas corpus throughout the indefinite\\r\\npeaceful future which I trust lies before them, any more than I am able to\\r\\nbelieve that a man could contract so strong an appetite for emetics during\\r\\ntemporary illness as to persist in feeding upon them during the remainder\\r\\nof his healthful life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn giving the resolutions that earnest consideration which you request of\\r\\nme, I cannot overlook the fact that the meeting speak as \"Democrats.\"\\r\\nNor can I, with full respect for their known intelligence, and the fairly\\r\\npresumed deliberation with which they prepared their resolutions, be\\r\\npermitted to suppose that this occurred by accident, or in any way other\\r\\nthan that they preferred to designate themselves \"Democrats\" rather than\\r\\n\"American citizens.\" In this time of national peril I would have preferred\\r\\nto meet you upon a level one step higher than any party platform, because\\r\\nI am sure that from such more elevated position we could do better battle\\r\\nfor the country we all love than we possibly can from those lower ones\\r\\nwhere, from the force of habit, the prejudices of the past, and selfish\\r\\nhopes of the future, we are sure to expend much of our ingenuity and\\r\\nstrength in finding fault with and aiming blows at each other. But since\\r\\nyou have denied me this I will yet be thankful for the country\\'s sake that\\r\\nnot all Democrats have done so. He on whose discretionary judgment Mr.\\r\\nVallandigham was arrested and tried is a Democrat, having no old party\\r\\naffinity with me, and the judge who rejected the constitutional view\\r\\nexpressed in these resolutions, by refusing to discharge Mr. Vallandigham\\r\\non habeas corpus is a Democrat of better days than these, having received\\r\\nhis judicial mantle at the hands of President Jackson. And still more: of\\r\\nall those Democrats who are nobly exposing their lives and shedding their\\r\\nblood on the battle-field, I have learned that many approve the course\\r\\ntaken with Mr. Vallandigham, while I have not heard of a single one\\r\\ncondemning it. I cannot assert that there are none such. And the name\\r\\nof President Jackson recalls an instance of pertinent history. After the\\r\\nbattle of New Orleans, and while the fact that the treaty of peace had\\r\\nbeen concluded was well known in the city, but before official knowledge\\r\\nof it had arrived, General Jackson still maintained martial or military\\r\\nlaw. Now that it could be said that the war was over, the clamor against\\r\\nmartial law, which had existed from the first, grew more furious. Among\\r\\nother things, a Mr. Louaillier published a denunciatory newspaper article.\\r\\nGeneral Jackson arrested him. A lawyer by the name of Morel procured the\\r\\nUnited States Judge Hall to order a writ of habeas corpus to release Mr.\\r\\nLouaillier. General Jackson arrested both the lawyer and the judge. A Mr.\\r\\nHollander ventured to say of some part of the matter that \"it was a dirty\\r\\ntrick.\" General Jackson arrested him. When the officer undertook to serve\\r\\nthe writ of habeas corpus, General Jackson took it from him, and sent him\\r\\naway with a copy. Holding the judge in custody a few days, the general\\r\\nsent him beyond the limits of his encampment, and set him at liberty with\\r\\nan order to remain till the ratification of peace should be regularly\\r\\nannounced, or until the British should have left the southern coast. A day\\r\\nor two more elapsed, the ratification of the treaty of peace was regularly\\r\\nannounced, and the judge and others were fully liberated. A few days more,\\r\\nand the judge called General Jackson into court and fined him $1000 for\\r\\nhaving arrested him and the others named. The General paid the fine, and\\r\\nthen the matter rested for nearly thirty years, when Congress refunded\\r\\nprincipal and interest. The late Senator Douglas, then in the House\\r\\nof Representatives, took a leading part in the debates, in which the\\r\\nconstitutional question was much discussed. I am not prepared to say whom\\r\\nthe journals would show to have voted for the measure.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be remarked--first, that we had the same Constitution then as now;\\r\\nsecondly, that we then had a case of invasion, and now we have a case of\\r\\nrebellion; and, thirdly, that the permanent right of the people to public\\r\\ndiscussion, the liberty of speech and of the press, the trial by jury, the\\r\\nlaw of evidence, and the habeas corpus suffered no detriment whatever\\r\\nby that conduct of General Jackson, or its subsequent approval by the\\r\\nAmerican Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet, let me say that, in my own discretion, I do not know whether I\\r\\nwould have ordered the arrest of Mr. Vallandigham. While I cannot shift\\r\\nthe responsibility from myself, I hold that, as a general rule, the\\r\\ncommander in the field is the better judge of the necessity in any\\r\\nparticular case. Of course I must practice a general directory and\\r\\nrevisory power in the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the resolutions expresses the opinion of the meeting that arbitrary\\r\\narrests will have the effect to divide and distract those who should be\\r\\nunited in suppressing the rebellion, and I am specifically called on to\\r\\ndischarge Mr. Vallandigham. I regard this as, at least, a fair appeal to\\r\\nme on the expediency of exercising a constitutional power which I think\\r\\nexists. In response to such appeal I have to say, it gave me pain when\\r\\nI learned that Mr. Vallandigham had been arrested (that is, I was pained\\r\\nthat there should have seemed to be a necessity for arresting him), and\\r\\nthat it will afford me great pleasure to discharge him so soon as I can by\\r\\nany means believe the public safety will not suffer by it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI further say that, as the war progresses, it appears to me, opinion and\\r\\naction, which were in great confusion at first, take shape and fall into\\r\\nmore regular channels, so that the necessity for strong dealing with them\\r\\ngradually decreases. I have every reason to desire that it should cease\\r\\naltogether, and far from the least is my regard for the opinions and\\r\\nwishes of those who, like the meeting at Albany, declare their purpose\\r\\nto sustain the government in every constitutional and lawful measure to\\r\\nsuppress the rebellion. Still, I must continue to do so much as may seem\\r\\nto be required by the public safety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

MALHIOT, BRADISH JOHNSON, AND THOMAS COTTMAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEMEN:--Your letter, which follows, has been received and Considered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The undersigned, a committee appointed by the planters of the State of\\r\\nLouisiana, respectfully represent that they have been delegated to seek of\\r\\nthe General Government a full recognition of all the rights of the State\\r\\nas they existed previous to the passage of an act of secession, upon the\\r\\nprinciple of the existence of the State constitution unimpaired, and no\\r\\nlegal act having transpired that could in any way deprive them of the\\r\\nadvantages conferred by that constitution. Under this constitution the\\r\\nState wishes to return to its full allegiance, in the enjoyment of all\\r\\nrights and privileges exercised by the other States under the Federal\\r\\nConstitution. With the view of accomplishing the desired object, we\\r\\nfurther request that your Excellency will, as commander-in-chief of the\\r\\narmy of the United States, direct the Military Governor of Louisiana to\\r\\norder an election, in conformity with the constitution and laws of the\\r\\nState, on the first Monday of November next, for all State and Federal\\r\\nofficers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With high consideration and resect, we have the honor to subscribe\\r\\nourselves,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your obedient servants,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"E. E. MALHIOT.\\r\\n     \"BRADISH JOHNSON.\\r\\n     \"THOMAS COTTMAN.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSince receiving the letter, reliable information has reached me that a\\r\\nrespectable portion of the Louisiana people desire to amend their State\\r\\nconstitution, and contemplate holding a State convention for that object.\\r\\nThis fact alone, as it seems to me, is a sufficient reason why the General\\r\\nGovernment should not give the committal you seek to the existing State\\r\\nconstitution. I may add that, while I do not perceive how such committal\\r\\ncould facilitate our military operations in Louisiana, I really apprehend\\r\\nit might be so used as to embarrass them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to an election to be held next November, there is abundant time without\\r\\nany order or proclamation from me just now. The people of Louisiana shall\\r\\nnot lack an opportunity for a fair election for both Federal and State\\r\\nofficers by want of anything within my power to give them.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour obedient servant,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 22, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL JOHN M. SCHOFIELD. MY DEAR SIR:--Your despatch, asking in\\r\\nsubstance whether, in case Missouri shall adopt gradual emancipation, the\\r\\nGeneral Government will protect slave owners in that species of property\\r\\nduring the short time it shall be permitted by the State to exist within\\r\\nit, has been received. Desirous as I am that emancipation shall be adopted\\r\\nby Missouri, and believing as I do that gradual can be made better than\\r\\nimmediate for both black and white, except when military necessity changes\\r\\nthe case, my impulse is to say that such protection would be given. I\\r\\ncannot know exactly what shape an act of emancipation may take. If the\\r\\nperiod from the initiation to the final end should be comparatively short,\\r\\nand the act should prevent persons being sold during that period into more\\r\\nlasting slavery, the whole would be easier. I do not wish to pledge the\\r\\nGeneral Government to the affirmative support of even temporary slavery\\r\\nbeyond what can be fairly claimed under the Constitution. I suppose,\\r\\nhowever, this is not desired, but that it is desired for the military\\r\\nforce of the United States, while in Missouri, to not be used in\\r\\nsubverting the temporarily reserved legal rights in slaves during the\\r\\nprogress of emancipation. This I would desire also. I have very earnestly\\r\\nurged the slave States to adopt emancipation; and it ought to be, and is,\\r\\nan object with me not to overthrow or thwart what any of them may in good\\r\\nfaith do to that end. You are therefore authorized to act in the spirit\\r\\nof this letter in conjunction with what may appear to be the military\\r\\nnecessities of your department. Although this letter will become public at\\r\\nsome time, it is not intended to be made so now.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

It is where you say: \"The undersigned are unable to\\r\\nagree with you in the opinion you have expressed that the Constitution is\\r\\ndifferent in time of insurrection or invasion from what it is in time of\\r\\npeace and public security.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA recurrence to the paper will show you that I have not expressed the\\r\\nopinion you suppose. I expressed the opinion that the Constitution is\\r\\ndifferent in its application in cases of rebellion or invasion, involving\\r\\nthe public safety, from what it is in times of profound peace and\\r\\npublic security; and this opinion I adhere to, simply because, by the\\r\\nConstitution itself, things may be done in the one case which may not be\\r\\ndone in the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nI dislike to waste a word on a merely personal point, but I must\\r\\nrespectfully assure you that you will find yourselves at fault should\\r\\nyou ever seek for evidence to prove your assumption that I \"opposed in\\r\\ndiscussions before the people the policy of the Mexican war.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou say: \"Expunge from the Constitution this limitation upon the power\\r\\nof Congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, and yet the other\\r\\nguarantees of personal liberty would remain unchanged.\" Doubtless, if this\\r\\nclause of the Constitution, improperly called, as I think, a limitation\\r\\nupon the power of Congress, were expunged, the other guarantees would\\r\\nremain the same; but the question is not how those guarantees would stand\\r\\nwith that clause out of the Constitution, but how they stand with that\\r\\nclause remaining in it, in case of rebellion or invasion involving the\\r\\npublic safety. If the liberty could be indulged of expunging that clause,\\r\\nletter and spirit, I really think the constitutional argument would be\\r\\nwith you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy general view on this question was stated in the Albany response, and\\r\\nhence I do not state it now. I only add that, as seems to me, the\\r\\nbenefit of the writ of habeas corpus is the great means through which the\\r\\nguarantees of personal liberty are conserved and made available in\\r\\nthe last resort; and corroborative of this view is the fact that Mr.\\r\\nVallandigham, in the very case in question, under the advice of able\\r\\nlawyers, saw not where else to go but to the habeas corpus. But by the\\r\\nConstitution the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus itself may be\\r\\nsuspended when, in case of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may\\r\\nrequire it.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou ask, in substance, whether I really claim that I may override all the\\r\\nguaranteed rights of individuals, on the plea of conserving the public\\r\\nsafety when I may choose to say the public safety requires it. This\\r\\nquestion, divested of the phraseology calculated to represent me as\\r\\nstruggling for an arbitrary personal prerogative, is either simply a\\r\\nquestion who shall decide, or an affirmation that nobody shall decide,\\r\\nwhat the public safety does require in cases of rebellion or invasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution contemplates the question as likely to occur for\\r\\ndecision, but it does not expressly declare who is to decide it. By\\r\\nnecessary implication, when rebellion or invasion comes, the decision is\\r\\nto be made from time to time; and I think the man whom, for the time, the\\r\\npeople have, under the Constitution, made the commander-in-chief of their\\r\\narmy and navy, is the man who holds the power and bears the responsibility\\r\\nof making it. If he uses the power justly, the same people will probably\\r\\njustify him; if he abuses it, he is in their hands to be dealt with by all\\r\\nthe modes they have reserved to themselves in the Constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earnestness with which you insist that persons can only, in times\\r\\nof rebellion, be lawfully dealt with in accordance with the rules for\\r\\ncriminal trials and punishments in times of peace, induces me to add a\\r\\nword to what I said on that point in the Albany response.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou claim that men may, if they choose, embarrass those whose duty it is\\r\\nto combat a giant rebellion, and then be dealt with in turn only as if\\r\\nthere were no rebellion. The Constitution itself rejects this view. The\\r\\nmilitary arrests and detentions which have been made, including those of\\r\\nMr. Vallandigham, which are not different in principle from the others,\\r\\nhave been for prevention, and not for punishment--as injunctions to stay\\r\\ninjury, as proceedings to keep the peace; and hence, like proceedings\\r\\nin such cases and for like reasons, they have not been accompanied with\\r\\nindictments, or trials by juries, nor in a single case by any punishment\\r\\nwhatever, beyond what is purely incidental to the prevention. The original\\r\\nsentence of imprisonment in Mr. Vallandigham\\'s case was to prevent injury\\r\\nto the military service only, and the modification of it was made as a\\r\\nless disagreeable mode to him of securing the same prevention.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am unable to perceive an insult to Ohio in the case of Mr. Vallandigham.\\r\\nQuite surely nothing of the sort was or is intended. I was wholly unaware\\r\\nthat Mr. Vallandigham was, at the time of his arrest, a candidate for the\\r\\nDemocratic nomination for governor until so informed by your reading to me\\r\\nthe resolutions of the convention. I am grateful to the State of Ohio for\\r\\nmany things, especially for the brave soldiers and officers she has given\\r\\nin the present national trial to the armies of the Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou claim, as I understand, that according to my own position in the\\r\\nAlbany response, Mr. Vallandigham should be released; and this because,\\r\\nas you claim, he has not damaged the military service by discouraging\\r\\nenlistments, encouraging desertions, or otherwise; and that if he had,\\r\\nhe should have been turned over to the civil authorities under the recent\\r\\nacts of Congress. I certainly do not know that Mr. Vallandigham has\\r\\nspecifically and by direct language advised against enlistments and in\\r\\nfavor of desertion and resistance to drafting.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all know that combinations, armed in some instances, to resist the\\r\\narrest of deserters began several months ago; that more recently the like\\r\\nhas appeared in resistance to the enrolment preparatory to a draft; and\\r\\nthat quite a number of assassinations have occurred from the same animus.\\r\\nThese had to be met by military force, and this again has led to bloodshed\\r\\nand death. And now, under a sense of responsibility more weighty and\\r\\nenduring than any which is merely official, I solemnly declare my belief\\r\\nthat this hindrance of the military, including maiming and murder, is\\r\\ndue to the course in which Mr. Vallandigham has been engaged in a greater\\r\\ndegree than to any other cause; and it is due to him personally in a\\r\\ngreater degree than to any other one man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese things have been notorious, known to all, and of course known to Mr.\\r\\nVallandigham. Perhaps I would not be wrong to say they originated with\\r\\nhis special friends and adherents. With perfect knowledge of them, he has\\r\\nfrequently if not constantly made speeches in Congress and before popular\\r\\nassemblies; and if it can be shown that, with these things staring him in\\r\\nthe face he has ever uttered a word of rebuke or counsel against them, it\\r\\nwill be a fact greatly in his favor with me, and one of which as yet I am\\r\\ntotally ignorant. When it is known that the whole burden of his speeches\\r\\nhas been to stir up men against the prosecution of the war, and that in\\r\\nthe midst of resistance to it he has not been known in any instance to\\r\\ncounsel against such resistance, it is next to impossible to repel the\\r\\ninference that he has counseled directly in favor of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith all this before their eyes, the convention you represent have\\r\\nnominated Mr. Vallandigham for governor of Ohio, and both they and\\r\\nyou have declared the purpose to sustain the national Union by all\\r\\nconstitutional means. But of course they and you in common reserve to\\r\\nyourselves to decide what are constitutional means; and, unlike the Albany\\r\\nmeeting, you omit to state or intimate that in your opinion an army is a\\r\\nconstitutional means of saving the Union against a rebellion, or even to\\r\\nintimate that you are conscious of an existing rebellion being in progress\\r\\nwith the avowed object of destroying that very Union. At the same time\\r\\nyour nominee for governor, in whose behalf you appeal, is known to you\\r\\nand to the world to declare against the use of an army to suppress the\\r\\nrebellion. Your own attitude, therefore, encourages desertion, resistance\\r\\nto the draft, and the like, because it teaches those who incline to desert\\r\\nand to escape the draft to believe it is your purpose to protect them, and\\r\\nto hope that you will become strong enough to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a short personal intercourse with you, gentlemen of the committee,\\r\\nI cannot say I think you desire this effect to follow your attitude; but\\r\\nI assure your that both friends and enemies of the Union look upon it in\\r\\nthis light. It is a substantial hope, and by consequence a real strength\\r\\nto the enemy. If it is a false hope, and one which you would willingly\\r\\ndispel, I will make the way exceedingly easy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI send you duplicates of this letter in order that you, or a majority of\\r\\nyou, may, if you choose, indorse your names upon one of them and return it\\r\\nthus indorsed to me with the understanding that those signing are thereby\\r\\ncommitted to the following propositions and to nothing else:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. That there is now a rebellion in the United States, the object and\\r\\ntendency of which is to destroy the National Union; and that, in your\\r\\nopinion, an army and navy are constitutional means for suppressing that\\r\\nrebellion;\\r\\n\\r\\n2. That no one of you will do anything which, in his own judgment,\\r\\nwill tend to hinder the increase, or favor the decrease, or lessen the\\r\\nefficiency of the army or navy while engaged in the effort to suppress\\r\\nthat rebellion; and\\r\\n\\r\\n3. That each of you will, in his sphere, do all he can to have the\\r\\nofficers, soldiers, and seamen of the army and navy, while engaged in\\r\\nthe effort to suppress the rebellion, paid, fed, clad, and otherwise well\\r\\nprovided for and supported.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with the further understanding that upon receiving the letter and\\r\\nnames thus indorsed, I will cause them to be published, which publication\\r\\nshall be, within itself, a revocation of the order in relation to Mr.\\r\\nVallandigham. It will not escape observation that I consent to the release\\r\\nof Mr. Vallandigham upon terms not embracing any pledge from him or from\\r\\nothers as to what he will or will not do. I do this because he is not\\r\\npresent to speak for himself, or to authorize others to speak for him;\\r\\nand because I should expect that on his returning he would not put himself\\r\\npractically in antagonism with the position of his friends. But I do it\\r\\nchiefly because I thereby prevail on other influential gentlemen of Ohio\\r\\nto so define their position as to be of immense value to the army--thus\\r\\nmore than compensating for the consequences of any mistake in allowing Mr.\\r\\nVallandigham to return; so that, on the whole, the public safety will not\\r\\nhave suffered by it. Still, in regard to Mr. Vallandigham and all others,\\r\\nI must hereafter, as heretofore, do so much as the public safety may seem\\r\\nto require.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have the honor to be respectfully yours, etc.,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONTINUED FAILURE TO PURSUE ENEMY\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\\r\\n\\r\\nSOLDIERS\\' HOME, WASHINGTON, JULY 6 1863.7 P.M.,\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\\r\\n\\r\\nI left the telegraph office a good deal dissatisfied. You know I did not\\r\\nlike the phrase--in Orders, No. 68, I believe--\"Drive the invaders from\\r\\nour soil.\" Since that, I see a despatch from General French, saying the\\r\\nenemy is crossing his wounded over the river in flats, without saying\\r\\nwhy he does not stop it, or even intimating a thought that it ought to\\r\\nbe stopped. Still later, another despatch from General Pleasonton, by\\r\\ndirection of General Meade, to General French, stating that the main army\\r\\nis halted because it is believed the rebels are concentrating \"on the\\r\\nroad towards Hagerstown, beyond Fairfield,\" and is not to move until it is\\r\\nascertained that the rebels intend to evacuate Cumberland Valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese things appear to me to be connected with a purpose to cover\\r\\nBaltimore and Washington and to get the enemy across the river again\\r\\nwithout a further collision, and they do not appear connected with a\\r\\npurpose to prevent his crossing and to destroy him. I do fear the former\\r\\npurpose is acted upon and the latter rejected.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are satisfied the latter purpose is entertained, and is judiciously\\r\\npursued, I am content. If you are not so satisfied, please look to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRESPONSE TO A SERENADE,\\r\\n\\r\\nJULY 7, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--I am very glad indeed to see you to-night, and yet I\\r\\nwill not say I thank you for this call; but I do most sincerely thank\\r\\nAlmighty God for the occasion on which you have called. How long ago is it\\r\\nEighty-odd years since, on the Fourth of July, for the first time in the\\r\\nhistory of the world, a nation, by its representatives, assembled and\\r\\ndeclared as a self-evident truth \"that all men are created equal.\" That\\r\\nwas the birthday of the United States of America. Since then the Fourth\\r\\nof July has had several very peculiar recognitions. The two men most\\r\\ndistinguished in the framing and support of the Declaration were Thomas\\r\\nJefferson and John Adams, the one having penned it, and the other\\r\\nsustained it the most forcibly in debate--the only two of the fifty-five\\r\\nwho signed it and were elected Presidents of the United States. Precisely\\r\\nfifty years after they put their hands to the paper, it pleased\\r\\nAlmighty God to take both from this stage of action. This was indeed an\\r\\nextraordinary and remarkable event in our history. Another President, five\\r\\nyears after, was called from this stage of existence on the same day and\\r\\nmonth of the year; and now on this last Fourth of July just passed, when\\r\\nwe have a gigantic rebellion, at the bottom of which is an effort to\\r\\noverthrow the principle that all men were created equal, we have the\\r\\nsurrender of a most powerful position and army on that very day. And not\\r\\nonly so, but in the succession of battles in Pennsylvania, near to us,\\r\\nthrough three days, so rapidly fought that they might be called one great\\r\\nbattle, on the first, second, and third of the month of July; and on the\\r\\nfourth the cohorts of those who opposed the Declaration that all men are\\r\\ncreated equal, \"turned tail\" and run.\\r\\n\\r\\nGentlemen, this is a glorious theme, and the occasion for a speech, but I\\r\\nam not prepared to make one worthy of the occasion. I would like to speak\\r\\nin terms of praise due to the many brave officers and soldiers who have\\r\\nfought in the cause of the Union and liberties of their country from the\\r\\nbeginning of the war. These are trying occasions, not only in success,\\r\\nbut for the want of success. I dislike to mention the name of one single\\r\\nofficer, lest I might do wrong to those I might forget. Recent events\\r\\nbring up glorious names, and particularly prominent ones; but these I will\\r\\nnot mention. Having said this much, I will now take the music.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSURRENDER OF VICKSBURG TO GENERAL GRANT\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM FROM GENERAL HALLECK TO GENERAL G. C. MEADE.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, D.C., July 7, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of the Potomac:\\r\\n\\r\\nI have received from the President the following note, which I\\r\\nrespectfully communicate:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have certain information that Vicksburg surrendered to General Grant\\r\\non the Fourth of July.

The\\r\\nforces you speak of will be of no imaginable service if they cannot go\\r\\nforward with a little more expedition. Lee is now passing the Potomac\\r\\nfaster than the forces you mention are passing Carlisle. Forces now beyond\\r\\nCarlisle to be joined by regiments still at Harrisburg, and the united\\r\\nforce again to join Pierce somewhere, and the whole to move down the\\r\\nCumberland Valley, will in my unprofessional opinion be quite as likely to\\r\\ncapture the \"man in the moon\" as any part of Lee\\'s army.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

I write to say a word further. When you\\r\\nfirst reached the vicinity of Vicksburg, I thought you should do what you\\r\\nfinally did--march the troops across the neck, run the batteries with the\\r\\ntransports, and thus go below; and I never had any faith except a general\\r\\nhope that you knew better than I, that the Yazoo Pass expedition and the\\r\\nlike could succeed. When you dropped below, and took Port Gibson, Grand\\r\\nGulf, and vicinity, I thought you should go down the river and join\\r\\nGeneral Banks; and when you turned northward, east of the Big Black, I\\r\\nfeared it was a mistake. I now wish to make the personal acknowledgment\\r\\nthat you were right and I was wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J.

VANCE.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--My former business partner, Mr. Frederic Kidder, of Boston,\\r\\nhas forwarded to me a letter he has recently received from his brother,\\r\\nEdward Kidder, of Wilmington, in which (Edward Kidder) says that he has\\r\\nhad an interview with you in which you expressed an anxiety for any peace\\r\\ncompatible with honor; that you regard slavery as already dead, and the\\r\\nestablishment of the Confederacy as hopeless; and that you should exert\\r\\nall your influence to bring about any reunion that would admit the South\\r\\non terms of perfect equality with the North.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn receipt of this letter I lost no time in laying it before the President\\r\\nof the United States, who expressed great gratification at hearing such\\r\\nsentiments from you, one of the most influential and honored of the\\r\\nSouthern governors, and he desires me to say that he fully shares your\\r\\nanxiety for the restoration of peace between the States and for a reunion\\r\\nof all the States on the basis of the abolition of slavery--the bone we\\r\\nare fighting over--and the full reinstatement of every Confederate citizen\\r\\nin all the rights of citizenship in our common country. These points\\r\\nconceded, the President authorizes me to say that he will be glad to\\r\\nreceive overtures from any man, or body of men, who have authority to\\r\\ncontrol the armies of the Confederacy; and that he and the United States\\r\\nCongress will be found very liberal on all collateral points that may come\\r\\nup in the settlement.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis views on the collateral points that may naturally arise, the President\\r\\ndesires me to say he will communicate to you through me if you should\\r\\nsuggest the personal interview that Mr. Edward Kidder recommends in his\\r\\nletter to his brother. In that case you will please forward to me, through\\r\\nMr. Kidder, your official permit, as Governor of North Carolina, to enter\\r\\nand leave the State, and to remain in it in safety during the pendency\\r\\nof these negotiations, which, I suppose, should be conducted in entire\\r\\nsecrecy until they assume an official character. With high consideration,\\r\\nI am,\\r\\n\\r\\nSincerely yours,\\r\\n\\r\\nJAMES R. GILMORE.\\r\\n\\r\\n [Indorsement.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter has been written in my presence, has been read by me, and has\\r\\nmy entire approval. A.L.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPROCLAMATION FOR THANKSGIVING, JULY 15, 1863\\r\\n\\r\\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\\r\\n\\r\\nA Proclamation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has pleased Almighty God to hearken to the supplications and prayers of\\r\\nan afflicted people, and to vouchsafe to the army and navy of the United\\r\\nStates victories on land and on the sea so signal and so effective as\\r\\nto furnish reasonable grounds for augmented confidence that the Union of\\r\\nthese States will be maintained, their Constitution preserved, and their\\r\\npeace and prosperity permanently restored. But these victories have\\r\\nbeen accorded not without sacrifices of life, limb, health, and liberty,\\r\\nincurred by brave, loyal, and patriotic citizens. Domestic affliction\\r\\nin every part of the country follows in the train of these fearful\\r\\nbereavements. It is meet and right to recognize and confess the presence\\r\\nof the Almighty Father, and the power of His hand equally in these\\r\\ntriumphs and in these sorrows.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, therefore, be it known that I do set apart Thursday, the 6th day of\\r\\nAugust next, to be observed as a day for national thanksgiving, praise,\\r\\nand prayer, and I invite the people of the United States to assemble on\\r\\nthat occasion in their customary places of worship, and, in the forms\\r\\napproved by their own consciences, render the homage due to the Divine\\r\\nMajesty for the wonderful things He has done in the nation\\'s behalf, and\\r\\ninvoke the influence of His Holy Spirit to subdue the anger which has\\r\\nproduced and so long sustained a needless and cruel rebellion, to change\\r\\nthe hearts of the insurgents, to guide the counsels of the Government with\\r\\nwisdom adequate to so great a national emergency, and to visit with tender\\r\\ncare and consolation throughout the length and breadth of our land all\\r\\nthose who, through the vicissitudes of marches, voyages, battles, and\\r\\nsieges have been, brought to suffer in mind, body, or estate, and finally\\r\\nto lead the whole nation through the paths of repentance and submission\\r\\nto the Divine Will back to the perfect enjoyment of union and fraternal\\r\\npeace.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\\r\\nUnited States to be affixed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDone at the city of Washington, this fifteenth day of July, in the year\\r\\nof our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the\\r\\nindependence of the United States of America the eighty-eighth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy, the President  WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\\r\\n  Secretary of State.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO L. SWETT.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cipher.]\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, July 15, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. L SWETT, San Francisco, Cal.:\\r\\n\\r\\nMany persons are telegraphing me from California, begging me for the peace\\r\\nof the State to suspend the military enforcement of the writ of possession\\r\\nin the Almaden case, while you are the single one who urges the contrary.\\r\\nYou know I would like to oblige you, but it seems to me my duty in this\\r\\ncase is the other way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO SIMON CAMERON.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cipher.]\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, JULY 15, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. SIMON CAMERON, Harrisburg, Pa.:\\r\\n\\r\\nYour despatch of yesterday received. Lee was already across the river\\r\\nwhen you sent it. I would give much to be relieved of the impression that\\r\\nMeade, Couch, Smith, and all since the battle at Gettysburg, have striven\\r\\nonly to get Lee over the river without another fight. Please tell me,\\r\\nif you know, who was the one corps commander who was for fighting in the\\r\\ncouncil of war on Sunday night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL LANE.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 17 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. S. H. LANE.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--Governor Carney has not asked to [have] General Blunt\\r\\nremoved, or interfered with, in his military operations. He has asked that\\r\\nhe, the Governor, be allowed to commission officers for troops raised in\\r\\nKansas, as other governors of loyal States do; and I think he is right in\\r\\nthis.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has asked that General Blunt shall not take persons charged with civil\\r\\ncrimes out of the hands of the courts and turn them over to mobs to be\\r\\nhung; and I think he is right in this also. He has asked that General\\r\\nEwing\\'s department be extended to include all Kansas; and I have not\\r\\ndetermined whether this is right or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR MORTON.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, D. C., July 18, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nGOVERNOR O. P. MORTON, Indianapolis:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do you remember about the case of John O. Brown, convicted of\\r\\nmutinous conduct and sentenced to death? What do you desire about it?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GOVERNOR PARKER\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 20, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIS EXCELLENCY JOEL PARKER, Governor of New Jersey.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 15th has been received, and considered by the\\r\\nSecretary of War and myself. I was pained to be informed this morning by\\r\\nthe Provost-Marshal-General that New Jersey is now behind twelve thousand,\\r\\nirrespective of the draft. I did not have time to ascertain by what rules\\r\\nthis was made out; and I shall be very glad if it shall, by any means,\\r\\nprove to be incorrect. He also tells me that eight thousand will be about\\r\\nthe quota of New Jersey on the first draft; and the Secretary of War\\r\\nsays the first draft in that State would not be made for some time in any\\r\\nevent. As every man obtained otherwise lessens the draft so much, and this\\r\\nmay supersede it altogether, I hope you will push forward your volunteer\\r\\nregiments as fast as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a very delicate matter to postpone the draft in one State, because\\r\\nof the argument it furnishes others to have postponement also. If we could\\r\\nhave a reason in one case which would be good if presented in all cases,\\r\\nwe could act upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will thank you, therefore, to inform me, if you can, by what day, at\\r\\nthe earliest, you can promise to have ready to be mustered into the United\\r\\nStates service the eight thousand men.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you can make a reliable promise (I mean one which you can rely on\\r\\nyourself) of this sort, it will be of great value, if the day is not too\\r\\nremote.\\r\\n\\r\\nI beg you to be assured I wish to avoid the difficulties you dread as much\\r\\nas yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour obedient servant,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL SCHOFIELD.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON D.C. JULY 20, 1863\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR GENERAL JOHN M. SCHOFIELD.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR GENERAL:--I have received and read your letter of the 14th of\\r\\nJuly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the suggestion you make, of discontinuing proceedings against\\r\\nMr. McKee, a very proper one. While I admit that there is an apparent\\r\\nimpropriety in the publication of the letter mentioned, without my consent\\r\\nor yours, it is still a case where no evil could result, and which I am\\r\\nentirely willing to overlook.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, D.C. JULY 22, 1863\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR GENERAL SCHOFIELD, St. Louis, Mo.:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following despatch has been placed in my hands. Please look to the\\r\\nsubject of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLEXINGTON, Mo., JULY 21, 1863 HON. S C. POMEROY: Under Orders No.63 the\\r\\nsheriff is arresting slaves of rebels inside our lines, and returning them\\r\\nin great numbers. Can he do it? Answer. GOULD.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO POSTMASTER-GENERAL BLAIR\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\\r\\n\\r\\nJULY 24, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. POSTMASTER-GENERAL\\r\\n\\r\\nSIR:-Yesterday little indorsements of mine went to you in two cases\\r\\nof postmasterships sought for widows whose husbands have fallen in the\\r\\nbattles of this war. These cases occurring on the same day brought me to\\r\\nreflect more attentively than I had before done, as to what is fairly due\\r\\nfrom us herein the dispensing of patronage toward the men who, by fighting\\r\\nour battles, bear the chief burden of serving our country. My conclusion\\r\\nis that, other claims and qualifications being equal, they have the better\\r\\nright and this is especially applicable to the disabled and the soldier,\\r\\ndeceased soldier\\'s family.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour obedient servant,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 25, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\\r\\n\\r\\nSIR:--Certain matters have come to my notice, and considered by me, which\\r\\ninduce me to believe that it will conduce to the public interest for\\r\\nyou to add to the general instructions given to our naval commanders in\\r\\nrelation to contraband trade propositions substantially as follows, to\\r\\nwit:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst. You will avoid the reality, and as far as possible the appearance,\\r\\nof using any neutral port to watch neutral vessels and then to dart out\\r\\nand seize them on their departure.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE.--Complaint is made that this has been practiced at the port of St\\r\\nThomas, which practice, if it exists, is disapproved and must cease.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond. You will not in any case detain the crew of a captured neutral\\r\\nvessel or any other subject of a neutral power on board such vessel,\\r\\nas prisoners of war or otherwise, except the small number necessary as\\r\\nwitnesses in the prize court.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE.-The practice here forbidden is also charged to exist, which, if\\r\\ntrue, is disapproved and must cease.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy dear sir, it is not intended to be insinuated that you have been\\r\\nremiss in the performance of the arduous and responsible duties of your\\r\\ndepartment, which, I take pleasure in affirming, has in your hands been\\r\\nconducted with admirable success. Yet, while your subordinates are almost\\r\\nof necessity brought into angry collision with the subjects of foreign\\r\\nstates, the representatives of those states and yourself do not come into\\r\\nimmediate contact for the purpose of keeping the peace, in spite of such\\r\\ncollisions. At that point there is an ultimate and heavy responsibility\\r\\nupon me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I propose is in strict accordance with international law, and is\\r\\ntherefore unobjectionable; whilst, if it does no other good, it will\\r\\ncontribute to sustain a considerable portion of the present British\\r\\nministry in their places, who, if displaced, are sure to be replaced by\\r\\nothers more unfavorable to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour obedient servant,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLETTER TO GOVERNOR PARKER.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 25, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR JOEL PARKER.\\r\\n\\r\\nSIR:--Yours of the 21st is received, and I have taken time and considered\\r\\nand discussed the subject with the Secretary of War and Provost-Marshal\\r\\nGeneral, in order, if possible, to make you a more favorable answer than I\\r\\nfinally find myself able to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a vital point with us to not have a special stipulation with the\\r\\ngovernor of any one State, because it would breed trouble in many, if not\\r\\nall, other States; and my idea was when I wrote you, as it still is, to\\r\\nget a point of time to which we could wait, on the reason that we were not\\r\\nready ourselves to proceed, and which might enable you to raise the quota\\r\\nof your State, in whole, or in large part, without the draft. The points\\r\\nof time you fix are much farther off than I had hoped. We might have got\\r\\nalong in the way I have indicated for twenty, or possibly thirty, days. As\\r\\nit stands, the best I can say is that every volunteer you will present us\\r\\nwithin thirty days from this date, fit and ready to be mustered into the\\r\\nUnited States service, on the usual terms, shall be pro tanto an abatement\\r\\nof your quota of the draft. That quota I can now state at eight thousand\\r\\nseven hundred and eighty-three (8783). No draft from New Jersey, other\\r\\nthan for the above quota, will be made before an additional draft, common\\r\\nto [all] the States, shall be required; and I may add that if we get well\\r\\nthrough with this draft, I entertain a strong hope that any further\\r\\none may never be needed. This expression of hope, however, must not be\\r\\nconstrued into a promise.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to conducting the draft by townships, I find it would require such a\\r\\nwaste of labor already done, and such an additional amount of it, and such\\r\\na loss of time, as to make it, I fear, inadmissible.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour obedient servant,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\nP. S.--Since writing the above, getting additional information, I\\r\\nam enabled to say that the draft may be made in subdistricts, as the\\r\\nenrolment has been made, or is in process of making. This will amount\\r\\npractically to drafting by townships, as the enrollment subdistricts are\\r\\ngenerally about the extent of townships. A.L.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo GENERAL G. G. MEADE. (Private.)\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 27, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE:\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not thrown General Hooker away; and therefore I would like to know\\r\\nwhether it would be agreeable to you, all things considered, for him to\\r\\ntake a corps under you, if he himself is willing to do so. Write me in\\r\\nperfect freedom, with the assurance that I will not subject you to any\\r\\nembarrassment by making your letter or its contents known to any one. I\\r\\nwish to know your wishes before I decide whether to break the subject\\r\\nto him. Do not lean a hair\\'s breadth against your own feelings, or your\\r\\njudgment of the public service, on the idea of gratifying me.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL A. B. BURNSIDE.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, July 27, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Cincinnati, O.:\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me explain. In General Grant\\'s first despatch after the fall of\\r\\nVicksburg, he said, among other things, he would send the Ninth Corps to\\r\\nyou. Thinking it would be pleasant to you, I asked the Secretary of War to\\r\\ntelegraph you the news. For some reasons never mentioned to us by General\\r\\nGrant, they have not been sent, though we have seen outside intimations\\r\\nthat they took part in the expedition against Jackson. General Grant is\\r\\na copious worker and fighter, but a very meager writer or telegrapher.\\r\\nNo doubt he changed his purpose in regard to the Ninth Corps for some\\r\\nsufficient reason, but has forgotten to notify us of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, July 29, 1863\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing General Meade\\'s despatch of yesterday to yourself causes me to fear\\r\\nthat he supposes the Government here is demanding of him to bring on a\\r\\ngeneral engagement with Lee as soon as possible. I am claiming no such\\r\\nthing of him. In fact, my judgment is against it; which judgment, of\\r\\ncourse, I will yield if yours and his are the contrary. If he could not\\r\\nsafely engage Lee at Williamsport, it seems absurd to suppose he can\\r\\nsafely engage him now, when he has scarcely more than two thirds of\\r\\nthe force he had at Williamsport, while it must be that Lee has been\\r\\nreinforced. True, I desired General Meade to pursue Lee across the\\r\\nPotomac, hoping, as has proved true, that he would thereby clear the\\r\\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad, and get some advantages by harassing him on\\r\\nhis retreat. These being past, I am unwilling he should now get into a\\r\\ngeneral engagement on the impression that we here are pressing him, and\\r\\nI shall be glad for you to so inform him, unless your own judgment is\\r\\nagainst it.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 29, 1863\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\\r\\n\\r\\nSIR:--Can we not renew the effort to organize a force to go to western\\r\\nTexas?\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease consult with the general-in-chief on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Governor of New Jersey shall furnish any new regiments, might not\\r\\nthey be put into such an expedition? Please think of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe no local object is now more desirable.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nORDER OF RETALIATION.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 30, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the duty of every government to give protection to its citizens, of\\r\\nwhatever class, color, or condition, and especially to those who are duly\\r\\norganized as soldiers in the public service. The law of nations and the\\r\\nusages and customs of war, as carried on by civilized powers, permit no\\r\\ndistinction as to color in the treatment of prisoners of war as public\\r\\nenemies. To sell or enslave any captured person, on account of his color\\r\\nand for no offense against the laws of war, is a relapse into barbarism,\\r\\nand a crime against the civilization of the age.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government of the United States will give the same protection to all\\r\\nits soldiers; and if the enemy shall sell or enslave any one because of\\r\\nhis color, the offense shall be punished by retaliation upon the enemy\\'s\\r\\nprisoners in our possession.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is therefore ordered that for every soldier of the United States killed\\r\\nin violation of the laws of war, a rebel soldier shall be executed; and\\r\\nfor every one enslaved by the enemy or sold into slavery, a rebel soldier\\r\\nshall be placed at hard labor on the public works, and continued at such\\r\\nlabor until the other shall be released and receive the treatment due to a\\r\\nprisoner of war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL S. A. HURLBUT.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 31, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR GENERAL HURLBUT:\\r\\n\\r\\nYour letter by Mr. Dana was duly received. I now learn that your\\r\\nresignation has reached the War Department. I also learn that an active\\r\\ncommand has been assigned you by General Grant. The Secretary of War and\\r\\nGeneral Halleck are very partial to you, as you know I also am. We all\\r\\nwish you to reconsider the question of resigning; not that we would\\r\\nwish to retain you greatly against your wish and interest, but that your\\r\\ndecision may be at least a very well-considered one.\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand that Senator [William K.] Sebastian, of Arkansas, thinks of\\r\\noffering to resume his place in the Senate. Of course the Senate, and not\\r\\nI, would decide whether to admit or reject him. Still I should feel great\\r\\ninterest in the question. It may be so presented as to be one of the very\\r\\ngreatest national importance; and it may be otherwise so presented as to\\r\\nbe of no more than temporary personal consequence to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emancipation Proclamation applies to Arkansas. I think it is valid\\r\\nin law, and will be so held by the courts. I think I shall not retract\\r\\nor repudiate it. Those who shall have tasted actual freedom I believe can\\r\\nnever be slaves or quasi-slaves again. For the rest, I believe some plan\\r\\nsubstantially being gradual emancipation would be better for both white\\r\\nand black. The Missouri plan recently adopted, I do not object to on\\r\\naccount of the time for ending the institution; but I am sorry the\\r\\nbeginning should have been postponed for seven years, leaving all that\\r\\ntime to agitate for the repeal of the whole thing. It should begin at\\r\\nonce, giving at least the new-born a vested interest in freedom which\\r\\ncould not be taken away. If Senator Sebastian could come with something\\r\\nof this sort from Arkansas, I, at least, should take great interest in his\\r\\ncase; and I believe a single individual will have scarcely done the world\\r\\nso great a service. See him if you can, and read this to him; but charge\\r\\nhim not to make it public for the present. Write me again.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM FROM GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\\r\\n\\r\\nALBANY, August 1, 1863.

LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL FOSTER.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 3, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL FOSTER (or whoever may be in command of the military\\r\\ndepartment with headquarters at Fort Monroe, Va.):\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Dr. Wright, on trial at Norfolk, has been or shall be convicted, send\\r\\nme a transcript of his trial and conviction, and do not let execution be\\r\\ndone upon him until my further order.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 5,1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR GENERAL BANKS:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I very well know what I would be glad for Louisiana to do, it is\\r\\nquite a different thing for me to assume direction of the matter. I would\\r\\nbe glad for her to make a new constitution, recognizing the emancipation\\r\\nproclamation, and adopting emancipation in those parts of the State to\\r\\nwhich the proclamation does not apply. And while she is at it, I think it\\r\\nwould not be objectionable for her to adopt some practical system by which\\r\\nthe two races could gradually live themselves out of their old relation to\\r\\neach other, and both come out better prepared for the new. Education\\r\\nfor young blacks should be included in the plan. After all, the power or\\r\\nelement of \"contract\" may be sufficient for this probationary period, and\\r\\nby its simplicity and flexibility may be the better.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an antislavery man, I have a motive to desire emancipation which\\r\\nproslavery men do not have but even they have strong enough reason to\\r\\nthus place themselves again under the shield of the Union, and to thus\\r\\nperpetually hedge against the recurrence of the scenes through which we\\r\\nare now passing.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor Shepley has informed me that Mr. Durant is now taking a registry,\\r\\nwith a view to the election of a constitutional convention in Louisiana.\\r\\nThis, to me, appears proper. If such convention were to ask my views, I\\r\\ncould present little else than what I now say to you. I think the thing\\r\\nshould be pushed forward, so that, if possible, its mature work may reach\\r\\nhere by the meeting of Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor my own part, I think I shall not, in any event, retract the\\r\\nemancipation proclamation: nor, as executive, ever return to slavery any\\r\\nperson who is free by the terms of that proclamation, or by any of the\\r\\nacts of Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Louisiana shall send members to Congress, their admission to seats\\r\\nwill depend, as you know, upon the respective Houses, and not upon the\\r\\nPresident.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 7, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIS EXCELLENCY HORATIO SEYMOUR, Governor of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nYour communication of the 3rd instant has been received and attentively\\r\\nconsidered.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot consent to suspend the draft in New York, as you request,\\r\\nbecause, among other reasons, time is too important.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the figures you send, which I presume are correct, the twelve districts\\r\\nrepresented fall into two classes of eight and four respectively. The\\r\\ndisparity of the quotas for the draft in these two classes is certainly\\r\\nvery striking, being the difference between an average of 2200 in one\\r\\nclass and 4864 in the other. Assuming that the districts are equal one to\\r\\nanother in entire population, as required by the plan on which they were\\r\\nmade, this disparity is such as to require attention. Much of it, however,\\r\\nI suppose will be accounted for by the fact that so many more persons fit\\r\\nfor soldiers are in the city than are in the country who have too recently\\r\\narrived from other parts of the United States and from Europe to be either\\r\\nincluded in the census of 1860, or to have voted in 1862. Still, making\\r\\ndue allowance for this, I am yet unwilling to stand upon it as an entirely\\r\\nsufficient explanation of the great disparity.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall direct the draft to proceed in all the districts, drawing,\\r\\nhowever, at first from each of the four districts--to wit, the Second,\\r\\nFourth, Sixth, and Eighth--only, 2200 being the average quota of the other\\r\\nclass. After this drawing, these four districts, and also the Seventeenth\\r\\nand Twenty-ninth, shall be carefully re-enrolled; and, if you please,\\r\\nagents of yours may witness every step of the process. Any deficiency\\r\\nwhich may appear by the new enrolment will be supplied by a special draft\\r\\nfor that object, allowing due credit for volunteers who may be obtained\\r\\nfrom these districts respectively during the interval; and at all points,\\r\\nso far as consistent with practical convenience, due credits shall be\\r\\ngiven for volunteers, and your Excellency shall be notified of the time\\r\\nfixed for commencing the draft in each district.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not object to abide a decision of the United States Supreme Court, or\\r\\nof the judges thereof, on the constitutionality of the draft law. In\\r\\nfact, I should be willing to facilitate the obtaining of it. But I cannot\\r\\nconsent to lose the time while it is being obtained. We are contending\\r\\nwith an enemy who, as I understand, drives every able-bodied man he can\\r\\nreach into his ranks, very much as a butcher drives bullocks into the\\r\\nslaughter-pen. No time is wasted, no argument is used. This produces an\\r\\narmy which will soon turn upon our now victorious soldiers already in the\\r\\nfield, if they shall not be sustained by recruits as they should be. It\\r\\nproduces an army with a rapidity not to be matched on our side if we first\\r\\nwaste time to re-experiment with the volunteer system, already deemed by\\r\\nCongress, and palpably, in fact, so far exhausted as to be inadequate;\\r\\nand then more time to obtain a court decision as to whether a law is\\r\\nconstitutional, which requires a part of those not now in the service\\r\\nto go to the aid of those who are already in it; and still more time to\\r\\ndetermine with absolute certainty that we get those who are to go in the\\r\\nprecisely legal proportion to those who are not to go. My purpose is to be\\r\\nin my action just and constitutional, and yet practical, in performing the\\r\\nimportant duty with which I am charged, of maintaining the unity and the\\r\\nfree principles of our common country.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour obedient servant,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, August 9, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR GENERAL GRANT:\\r\\n\\r\\nI see by a despatch of yours that you incline quite strongly toward an\\r\\nexpedition against Mobile. This would appear tempting to me also, were it\\r\\nnot that in view of recent events in Mexico I am greatly impressed with\\r\\nthe importance of re-establishing the national authority in western Texas\\r\\nas soon as possible. I am not making an order, however; that I leave, for\\r\\nthe present at least, to the general-in-chief.\\r\\n\\r\\nA word upon another subject: General Thomas has gone again to the\\r\\nMississippi Valley, with the view of raising colored troops. I have no\\r\\nreason to doubt that you are doing what you reasonably can upon the same\\r\\nsubject. I believe it is a resource which if vigorously applied now\\r\\nwill soon close the contest. It works doubly, weakening the enemy and\\r\\nstrengthening us. We were not fully ripe for it until the river was\\r\\nopened. Now, I think at least one hundred thousand can and ought to be\\r\\nrapidly organized along its shores, relieving all white troops to serve\\r\\nelsewhere. Mr. Dana understands you as believing that the Emancipation\\r\\nProclamation has helped some in your military operations. I am very glad\\r\\nif this is so.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid you receive a short letter from me dated the 13th of July?\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 10, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR GENERAL ROSECRANS:\\r\\n\\r\\nYours of the 1st was received two days ago. I think you must have inferred\\r\\nmore than General Halleck has intended, as to any dissatisfaction of mine\\r\\nwith you. I am sure you, as a reasonable man, would not have been wounded\\r\\ncould you have heard all my words and seen all my thoughts in regard to\\r\\nyou. I have not abated in my kind feeling for and confidence in you. I\\r\\nhave seen most of your despatches to General Halleck--probably all of\\r\\nthem. After Grant invested Vicksburg I was very anxious lest Johnston\\r\\nshould overwhelm him from the outside, and when it appeared certain that\\r\\npart of Bragg\\'s force had gone and was going to Johnston, it did seem to\\r\\nme it was exactly the proper time for you to attack Bragg with what force\\r\\nhe had left. In all kindness let me say it so seems to me yet. Finding\\r\\nfrom your despatches to General Halleck that your judgment was different,\\r\\nand being very anxious for Grant, I, on one occasion, told General Halleck\\r\\nI thought he should direct you to decide at once to immediately attack\\r\\nBragg or to stand on the defensive and send part of your force to Grant.\\r\\nHe replied he had already so directed in substance. Soon after, despatches\\r\\nfrom Grant abated my anxiety for him, and in proportion abated my anxiety\\r\\nabout any movement of yours. When afterward, however, I saw a despatch of\\r\\nyours arguing that the right time for you to attack Bragg was not before,\\r\\nbut would be after, the fall of Vicksburg, it impressed me very strangely,\\r\\nand I think I so stated to the Secretary of War and General Halleck. It\\r\\nseemed no other than the proposition that you could better fight Bragg\\r\\nwhen Johnston should be at liberty to return and assist him than you could\\r\\nbefore he could so return to his assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Grant has been entirely relieved by the fall of Vicksburg, by which\\r\\nJohnston is also relieved, it has seemed to me that your chance for a\\r\\nstroke has been considerably diminished, and I have not been pressing you\\r\\ndirectly or indirectly. True, I am very anxious for East Tennessee to be\\r\\noccupied by us; but I see and appreciate the difficulties you mention. The\\r\\nquestion occurs, Can the thing be done at all? Does preparation advance at\\r\\nall? Do you not consume supplies as fast as you get them forward? Have you\\r\\nmore animals to-day than you had at the battle of Stone\\'s River? And\\r\\nyet have not more been furnished you since then than your entire present\\r\\nstock? I ask the same questions as to your mounted force.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not misunderstand: I am not casting blame upon you; I rather think\\r\\nby great exertion you can get to East Tennessee; but a very important\\r\\nquestion is, Can you stay there? I make no order in the case--that I leave\\r\\nto General Halleck and yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now be assured once more that I think of you in all kindness and\\r\\nconfidence, and that I am not watching you with an evil eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, August 11.1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIS EXCELLENCY HORATIO SEYMOUR, Governor of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nYours of the 8th, with Judge-Advocate-General Waterbury\\'s report, was\\r\\nreceived to-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsking you to remember that I consider time as being very important, both\\r\\nto the general cause of the country and to the soldiers in the field, I\\r\\nbeg to remind you that I waited, at your request, from the 1st until the\\r\\n6th inst., to receive your communication dated the 3d. In view of\\r\\nits great length, and the known time and apparent care taken in its\\r\\npreparation, I did not doubt that it contained your full case as you\\r\\ndesired to present it. It contained the figures for twelve districts,\\r\\nomitting the other nineteen, as I suppose, because you found nothing to\\r\\ncomplain of as to them. I answered accordingly. In doing so I laid down\\r\\nthe principle to which I purpose adhering, which is to proceed with the\\r\\ndraft, at the same time employing infallible means to avoid any great\\r\\nwrong. With the communication received to-day you send figures for\\r\\ntwenty-eight districts, including the twelve sent before, and still\\r\\nomitting three, for which I suppose the enrolments are not yet received.\\r\\nIn looking over the fuller list of twenty-eight districts, I find that the\\r\\nquotas for sixteen of them are above 2000 and below 2700, while, of the\\r\\nrest, six are above 2700 and six are below 2000. Applying the principle to\\r\\nthese new facts, the Fifth and Seventh districts must be added to the four\\r\\nin which the quotas have already been reduced to 2200 for the first draft;\\r\\nand with these four others just be added to those to be re-enrolled. The\\r\\ncorrect case will then stand: the quotas of the Second, Fourth, Fifth,\\r\\nSixth, Seventh, and Eighth districts fixed at 2200 for the first draft.\\r\\nThe Provost-Marshal-General informs me that the drawing is already\\r\\ncompleted in the Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Twenty-second,\\r\\nTwenty-fourth, Twenty-sixth, Twenty-seventh, Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth,\\r\\nand Thirtieth districts. In the others, except the three outstanding, the\\r\\ndrawing will be made upon the quotas as now fixed. After the first draft,\\r\\nthe Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Sixteenth, Seventeenth,\\r\\nTwenty-first, Twenty-fifth, Twenty-ninth, and Thirty-first will be\\r\\nenrolled for the purpose and in the manner stated in my letter of the 7th\\r\\ninst. The same principle will be applied to the now outstanding districts\\r\\nwhen they shall come in. No part of my former letter is repudiated by\\r\\nreason of not being restated in this, or for any other cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour obedient servant,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL J. A. McCLERNAND.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 12, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLERNAND.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--Our friend William G. Greene has just presented a kind\\r\\nletter in regard to yourself, addressed to me by our other friends Yates,\\r\\nHatch, and Dubois.\\r\\n\\r\\nI doubt whether your present position is more painful to you than to\\r\\nmyself. Grateful for the patriotic stand so early taken by you in this\\r\\nlife-and-death struggle of the nation, I have done whatever has appeared\\r\\npracticable to advance you and the public interest together. No charges,\\r\\nwith a view to a trial, have been preferred against you by any one; nor do\\r\\nI suppose any will be. All there is, so far as I have heard, is General\\r\\nGrant\\'s statement of his reasons for relieving you. And even this I have\\r\\nnot seen or sought to see; because it is a case, as appears to me, in\\r\\nwhich I could do nothing without doing harm. General Grant and yourself\\r\\nhave been conspicuous in our most important successes; and for me to\\r\\ninterfere and thus magnify a breach between you could not but be of evil\\r\\neffect. Better leave it where the law of the case has placed it. For me to\\r\\nforce you back upon General Grant would be forcing him to resign. I cannot\\r\\ngive you a new command, because we have no forces except such as already\\r\\nhave commanders.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am constantly pressed by those who scold before they think, or without\\r\\nthinking at all, to give commands respectively to Fremont, McClellan,\\r\\nButler, Sigel, Curtis, Hunter, Hooker, and perhaps others, when, all else\\r\\nout of the way, I have no commands to give them. This is now your case;\\r\\nwhich, as I have said, pains me not less than it does you. My belief is\\r\\nthat the permanent estimate of what a general does in the field is fixed\\r\\nby the \"cloud of witnesses\" who have been with him in the field, and that,\\r\\nrelying on these, he who has the right needs not to fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour friend as ever,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, AUGUST 16, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nGOVERNOR SEYMOUR, New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nYour despatch of this morning is just received, and I fear I do not\\r\\nperfectly understand it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy view of the principle is that every soldier obtained voluntarily leaves\\r\\none less to be obtained by draft. The only difficulty is in applying the\\r\\nprinciple properly. Looking to time, as heretofore, I am unwilling to\\r\\ngive up a drafted man now, even for the certainty, much less for the mere\\r\\nchance, of getting a volunteer hereafter. Again, after the draft in any\\r\\ndistrict, would it not make trouble to take any drafted man out and put a\\r\\nvolunteer in--for how shall it be determined which drafted man is to have\\r\\nthe privilege of thus going out, to the exclusion of all the others? And\\r\\neven before the draft in any district the quota must be fixed; and the\\r\\ndraft must be postponed indefinitely if every time a volunteer is offered\\r\\nthe officers must stop and reconstruct the quota. At least I fear there\\r\\nmight be this difficulty; but, at all events, let credits for volunteers\\r\\nbe given up to the last moment which will not produce confusion or delay.\\r\\nThat the principle of giving credits for volunteers shall be applied by\\r\\ndistricts seems fair and proper, though I do not know how far by present\\r\\nstatistics it is practicable. When for any cause a fair credit is not\\r\\ngiven at one time, it should be given as soon thereafter as practicable.\\r\\nMy purpose is to be just and fair, and yet to not lose time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo J. H. HACKETT.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON August 17, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nJAMES H. HACKETT, Esq.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--Months ago I should have acknowledged the receipt of your\\r\\nbook and accompanying kind note; and I now have to beg your pardon for not\\r\\nhaving done so.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor one of my age I have seen very little of the drama. The first\\r\\npresentation of Falstaff I ever saw was yours here, last winter or spring.\\r\\nPerhaps the best compliment I can pay is to say, as I truly can, I am very\\r\\nanxious to see it again. Some of Shakespeare\\'s plays I have never read,\\r\\nwhile others I have gone over perhaps as frequently as any un-professional\\r\\nreader. Among the latter are Lear, Richard III., Henry VIII., Hamlet, and\\r\\nespecially Macbeth. I think nothing equals Macbeth. It is wonderful.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike you gentlemen of the profession, I think the soliloquy in Hamlet\\r\\ncommencing \"Oh, my offense is rank,\" surpasses that commencing \"To be or\\r\\nnot to be.\" But pardon this small attempt at criticism. I should like to\\r\\nhear you pronounce the opening speech of Richard III. Will you not soon\\r\\nvisit Washington again? If you do, please call and let me make your\\r\\npersonal acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO F. F. LOWE.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON, D. C., August 17, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. P. F. LOWE, San Francisco, Cal.:\\r\\n\\r\\nThere seems to be considerable misunderstanding about the recent movement\\r\\nto take possession of the \"New Almaden\" mine. It has no reference to any\\r\\nother mine or mines.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn regard to mines and miners generally, no change of policy by the\\r\\nGovernment has been decided on, or even thought of, so far as I know.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"New Almaden\" mine was peculiar in this: that its occupants claimed to\\r\\nbe the legal owners of it on a Mexican grant, and went into court on that\\r\\nclaim. The case found its way into the Supreme Court of the United States,\\r\\nand last term, in and by that court, the claim of the occupants was\\r\\ndecided to be utterly fraudulent. Thereupon it was considered the duty of\\r\\nthe Government by the Secretary of the Interior, the Attorney-General,\\r\\nand myself to take possession of the premises; and the Attorney-General\\r\\ncarefully made out the writ and I signed it. It was not obtained\\r\\nsurreptitiously, although I suppose General Halleck thought it had been,\\r\\nwhen he telegraphed, simply because he thought possession was about being\\r\\ntaken by a military order, while he knew no such order had passed through\\r\\nhis hands as general-in-chief.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe writ was suspended, upon urgent representations from California,\\r\\nsimply to keep the peace. It never had any direct or indirect reference to\\r\\nany mine, place, or person, except the \"New Almaden\" mine and the persons\\r\\nconnected with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

LINCOLN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO CRITICS OF EMANCIPATION\\r\\n\\r\\nTo J. C. CONKLING.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 26, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. JAMES C. CONKLING.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your letter inviting me to attend a mass meeting of\\r\\nunconditional Union men, to be held at the capital of Illinois, on the\\r\\n3d day of September, has been received. It would be very agreeable for\\r\\nme thus to meet my old friends at my own home, but I cannot just now be\\r\\nabsent from here so long as a visit there would require.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to\\r\\nthe Union, and I am sure that my old political friends will thank me for\\r\\ntendering, as I do, the nation\\'s gratitude to those other noble men whom\\r\\nno partisan malice or partisan hope can make false to the nation\\'s life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are those who are dissatisfied with me. To such I would say: You\\r\\ndesire peace, and you blame me that we do not have it. But how can we\\r\\nobtain it? There are but three conceivable ways:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst--to suppress the rebellion by force of arms. This I am trying to do.\\r\\nAre you for it? If you are, so far we are agreed. If you are not for it, a\\r\\nsecond way is to give up the Union. I am against this. Are you for it? If\\r\\nyou are you should say so plainly. If you are not for force nor yet for\\r\\ndissolution, there only remains some imaginable compromise.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not believe that any compromise embracing the maintenance of the\\r\\nUnion is now possible. All that I learn leads to a directly opposite\\r\\nbelief. The strength of the rebellion is its military, its army. That army\\r\\ndominates all the country and all the people within its range. Any offer\\r\\nof terms made by any man or men within that range, in opposition to that\\r\\narmy, is simply nothing for the present; because such man or men have no\\r\\npower whatever to enforce their side of a compromise, if one were made\\r\\nwith them.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo illustrate: Suppose refugees from the South and peace men of the North\\r\\nget together in convention, and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing\\r\\na restoration of the Union. In what way can that compromise be used to\\r\\nkeep Lee\\'s army out of Pennsylvania? Meade\\'s army can keep Lee\\'s army out\\r\\nof Pennsylvania, and, I think, can ultimately drive it out of existence.\\r\\nBut no paper compromise to which the controllers of Lee\\'s army are not\\r\\nagreed can at all affect that army. In an effort at such compromise we\\r\\nwould waste time, which the enemy would improve to our disadvantage; and\\r\\nthat would be all.\\r\\n\\r\\nA compromise, to be effective, must be made either with those who control\\r\\nthe rebel army, or with the people, first liberated from the domination of\\r\\nthat army by the success of our own army. Now allow me to assure you\\r\\nthat no word or intimation from that rebel army, or from any of the men\\r\\ncontrolling it, in relation to any peace compromise, has ever come to\\r\\nmy knowledge or belief. All charges and insinuations to the contrary are\\r\\ndeceptive and groundless. And I promise you that if any such proposition\\r\\nshall hereafter come, it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from you.\\r\\nI freely acknowledge myself to be the servant of the people, according to\\r\\nthe bond of service, the United States Constitution, and that, as such, I\\r\\nam responsible to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, to be plain: You are dissatisfied with me about the negro. Quite\\r\\nlikely there is a difference of opinion between you and myself upon\\r\\nthat subject. I certainly wish that all men could be free, while you,\\r\\nI suppose, do not. Yet, I have neither adopted nor proposed any measure\\r\\nwhich is not consistent with even your view, provided you are for the\\r\\nUnion. I suggested compensated emancipation; to which you replied you\\r\\nwished not to be taxed to buy negroes. But I had not asked you to be taxed\\r\\nto buy negroes, except in such way as to save you from greater taxation to\\r\\nsave the Union exclusively by other means.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou dislike the Emancipation Proclamation, and perhaps would have it\\r\\nretracted. You say it is unconstitutional. I think differently. I think\\r\\nthe Constitution invests its commander-in-chief with the law of war in\\r\\ntime of war. The most that can be said, if so much, is, that slaves are\\r\\nproperty. Is there, has there ever been, any question that by the law of\\r\\nwar, property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed? And\\r\\nis it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the enemy? Armies, the\\r\\nworld over, destroy enemies\\' property when they cannot use it, and even\\r\\ndestroy their own to keep it from the enemy. Civilized belligerents do all\\r\\nin their power to help themselves or hurt the enemy, except a few things\\r\\nregarded as barbarous or cruel. Among the exceptions are the massacre of\\r\\nvanquished foes and non-combatants, male and female.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the proclamation, as law, either is valid or is not valid. If it is\\r\\nnot valid it needs no retraction. If it is valid it cannot be retracted,\\r\\nany more than the dead can be brought to life. Some of you profess to\\r\\nthink its retraction would operate favorably for the Union, why better\\r\\nafter the retraction than before the issue? There was more than a year\\r\\nand a half of trial to suppress the rebellion before the proclamation was\\r\\nissued, the last one hundred days of which passed under an explicit notice\\r\\nthat it was coming, unless averted by those in revolt returning to their\\r\\nallegiance. The war has certainly progressed as favorably for us since the\\r\\nissue of the proclamation as before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know, as fully as one can know the opinions of others, that some of\\r\\nthe commanders of our armies in the field, who have given us our most\\r\\nimportant victories, believe the emancipation policy and the use of\\r\\ncolored troops constitute the heaviest blows yet dealt to the rebellion,\\r\\nand that at least one of those important successes could not have been\\r\\nachieved when it was but for the aid of black soldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the commanders who hold these views are some who have never had any\\r\\naffinity with what is called \"Abolitionism,\" or with \"Republican Party\\r\\npolitics,\" but who hold them purely as military opinions. I submit their\\r\\nopinions are entitled to some weight against the objections often urged\\r\\nthat emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures,\\r\\nand were not adopted as such in good faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou say that you will not fight to free negroes. Some of them seem willing\\r\\nto fight for you; but no matter. Fight you, then, exclusively, to save\\r\\nthe Union. I issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the\\r\\nUnion. Whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the Union, if\\r\\nI shall urge you to continue fighting, it will be an apt time then for\\r\\nyou to declare you will not fight to free negroes. I thought that in\\r\\nyour struggle for the Union, to whatever extent the negroes should cease\\r\\nhelping the enemy, to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance\\r\\nto you. Do you think differently? I thought that whatever negroes can be\\r\\ngot to do as soldiers, leaves just so much less for white soldiers to do\\r\\nin saving the Union. Does it appear otherwise to you? But negroes, like\\r\\nother people, act upon motives. Why should they do anything for us if we\\r\\nwill do nothing for them? If they stake their lives for us they must be\\r\\nprompted by the strongest motive, even the promise of freedom. And the\\r\\npromise, being made, must be kept.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe signs look better. The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the\\r\\nsea. Thanks to the great Northwest for it; nor yet wholly to them. Three\\r\\nhundred miles up they met New England, Empire, Keystone, and Jersey,\\r\\nhewing their way right and left. The sunny South, too, in more colors than\\r\\none, also lent a helping hand. On the spot, their part of the history was\\r\\njotted down in black and white. The job was a great national one, and let\\r\\nnone be slighted who bore an honorable part in it And while those who have\\r\\ncleared the great river may well be proud, even that is not all. It is\\r\\nhard to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than at\\r\\nAntietam, Murfreesboro, Gettysburg, and on many fields of less note. Nor\\r\\nmust Uncle Sam\\'s web-feet be forgotten. At all the watery margins they\\r\\nhave been present; not only on the deep sea, the broad bay, and the rapid\\r\\nriver, but also up the narrow, muddy bayou, and wherever the ground was a\\r\\nlittle damp, they have been and made their tracks. Thanks to all. For the\\r\\ngreat Republic--for the principle it lives by and keeps alive--for man\\'s\\r\\nvast future--thanks to all.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeace does not appear so distant as it did. I hope it will come soon, and\\r\\ncome to stay, and so come as to be worth the keeping in all future\\r\\ntime. It will then have been proved that among freemen there can be no\\r\\nsuccessful appeal from the ballot to the bullet, and that they who take\\r\\nsuch appeal are sure to lose their case and pay the cost. And there will\\r\\nbe some black men who can remember that with silent tongue, and clinched\\r\\nteeth, and steady eye, and well-poised bayonet, they have helped mankind\\r\\non to this great consummation; while I fear there will be some white ones\\r\\nunable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful speech they have\\r\\nstriven to hinder it.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, let us not be over-sanguine of a speedy, final triumph. Let us be\\r\\nquite sober. Let us diligently apply the means, never doubting that a just\\r\\nGod, in His own good time, will give us the rightful result.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

JAMES CONKLING.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR CONKLING:--I cannot leave here now. Herewith is a letter instead.\\r\\nYou are one of the best public readers. I have but one suggestion--read it\\r\\nvery slowly. And now God bless you, and all good Union men.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours as ever,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., August 26, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR SIR:-In my correspondence with Governor Seymour in\\r\\nrelation to the draft, I have said to him, substantially, that credits\\r\\nshall be given for volunteers up to the latest moment, before drawing in\\r\\nany district, that can be done without producing confusion or delay. In\\r\\norder to do this, let our mustering officers in New York and elsewhere be\\r\\nat, once instructed that whenever they muster into our service any number\\r\\nof volunteers, to at once make return to the War Department, both by\\r\\ntelegraph and mail, the date of the muster, the number mustered, and the\\r\\nCongressional or enrolment district or districts, of their residences,\\r\\ngiving the numbers separately for each district. Keep these returns\\r\\ndiligently posted, and by them give full credit on the quotas, if\\r\\npossible, on the last day before the draft begins in any district.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, I have informed Governor Seymour that he shall be notified of the\\r\\ntime when the draft is to commence in each district in his State. This\\r\\nis equally proper for all the States. In order to carry it out, I propose\\r\\nthat so soon as the day for commencing the draft in any district is\\r\\ndefinitely determined, the governor of the State, including the district,\\r\\nbe notified thereof, both by telegraph and mail, in form about as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n     ------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n     ------------------------ 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor of ------------------------------\\r\\n     ------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are notified that the draft will commence in the\\r\\n------------------ ---- district, at ------ on the\\r\\n ------ day ------------\\r\\n1863, at ------ A.M. of said day.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this by telegraph and mail.\\r\\n               ------------------------\\r\\n               ------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nThis notice may be given by the Provost-Marshal-General here, the\\r\\nsub-provost-marshal-generals in the States, or perhaps by the district\\r\\nprovost-marshals.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever we shall have so far proceeded in New York as to make the\\r\\nre-enrolment specially promised there practicable, I wish that also to go\\r\\nforward, and I wish Governor Seymour notified of it; so that if he choose,\\r\\nhe can place agents of his with ours to see the work fairly done.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., August 27. 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIS EXCELLENCY HORATIO SEYMOUR,\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nYours of the 21st, with exhibits, was received on the 24th.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the midst of pressing duties I have been unable to answer it sooner. In\\r\\nthe meantime the Provost Marshal-General has had access to yours, and has\\r\\naddressed a communication in relation to it to the Secretary of War, a\\r\\ncopy of which communication I herewith enclose to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndependently of this, I addressed a letter on the same subject to the\\r\\nSecretary of War, a copy of which I also enclose to you. The Secretary\\r\\nhas sent my letter to the Provost-Marshal General, with direction that\\r\\nhe adopt and follow the course therein pointed out. It will, of course,\\r\\noverrule any conflicting view of the Provost-Marshal-General, if there be\\r\\nsuch.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\nP. S.-I do not mean to say that if the Provost-Marshal-General can find\\r\\nit practicable to give credits by subdistricts, I overrule him in that.\\r\\nOn the contrary, I shall be glad of it; but I will not take the risk of\\r\\nover-burdening him by ordering him to do it.

M.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL SCHOFIELD, St. LOUIS:\\r\\n\\r\\nI have just received the despatch which follows, from two very influential\\r\\ncitizens of Kansas, whose names I omit.

I understand these are very flagrant\\r\\ncases, and that you deem their punishment as being indispensable to the\\r\\nservice. If I am not mistaken in this, please let them know at once that\\r\\ntheir appeal is denied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO F. C. SHERMAN AND J. S.

It seems to me\\r\\nthe Government here will be overwhelmed if it undertakes to conduct\\r\\nthese matters with the authorities of cities and counties. They must be\\r\\nconducted with the governors of States, who will, of course, represent\\r\\ntheir cities and counties.

Fort Sumter is certainly battered down and utterly useless\\r\\nto the enemy, and it is believed here, but not entirely certain, that both\\r\\nSumter and Fort Wagner are occupied by our forces. It is also certain that\\r\\nGeneral Gilmore has thrown some shot into the city of Charleston.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO J. C. CONKLING.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 31, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. JAMES C. CONKLING, Springfield, Ill.:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my letter of the 26th insert between the sentence ending \"since the\\r\\nissue of the Emancipation Proclamation as before\" and the next, commencing\\r\\n\"You say you will not fight, etc.,\" what follows below my signature\\r\\nhereto.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know as fully as one can know the opinions of others that some of\\r\\nthe commanders of our armies in the field, who have given us our most\\r\\nimportant successes, believe the emancipation policy and the use of\\r\\ncolored troops constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion,\\r\\nand that at least one of those important successes could not have been\\r\\nachieved when it was, but for the aid of black soldiers. Among the\\r\\ncommanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity\\r\\nwith what is called abolitionism, or with Republican party politics, but\\r\\nwho hold them purely as military opinions. I submit these opinions as\\r\\nbeing entitled to some weight against the objections, often urged, that\\r\\nemancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures and\\r\\nwere not adopted as such in good faith.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 31, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR GENERAL ROSECRANS:\\r\\n\\r\\nYours of the 22d was received yesterday. When I wrote you before, I did\\r\\nnot intend, nor do I now, to engage in an argument with you on military\\r\\nquestions. You had informed me you were impressed through General Halleck\\r\\nthat I was dissatisfied with you, and I could not bluntly deny that I was\\r\\nwithout unjustly implicating him. I therefore concluded to tell you the\\r\\nplain truth, being satisfied the matter would thus appear much smaller\\r\\nthan it would if seen by mere glimpses. I repeat that my appreciation of\\r\\nyou has not abated. I can never forget whilst I remember anything, that\\r\\nabout the end of last year and the beginning of this, you gave us a\\r\\nhard-earned victory, which, had there been a defeat instead, the nation\\r\\ncould hardly have lived over. Neither can I forget the check you so\\r\\nopportunely gave to a dangerous sentiment which was spreading in the\\r\\nNorth.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours, as ever,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 31, 1863\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not improbable that retaliation for the recent great outrage\\r\\nat Lawrence, in Kansas, may extend to indiscriminate slaughter on the\\r\\nMissouri border, unless averted by very judicious action. I shall be\\r\\nobliged if the general-in-chief can make any suggestions to General\\r\\nSchofield upon the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

JOSEPH SEGAR, Fort Monroe, Va.:\\r\\n\\r\\nI have just seen your despatch to the Secretary of War, who is absent.\\r\\nI also send a despatch from Major Hayner of the 3d showing that he had\\r\\nnotice of my order, and stating that the people were jubilant over it, as\\r\\na victory over the Government extorted by fear, and that he had already\\r\\ncollected about $4000 of the money. If he has proceeded since, I shall\\r\\nhold him accountable for his contumacy. On the contrary, no dollar shall\\r\\nbe refunded by my order until it shall appear that my act in the case has\\r\\nbeen accepted in the right spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

I suppose it was intended by Congress\\r\\nthat this government should execute the act in question without dependence\\r\\nupon any other government, State, city, or county. It is, however, within\\r\\nthe range of practical convenience to confer with the governments of\\r\\nStates, while it is quite beyond that range to have correspondence on the\\r\\nsubject with counties and cities. They are too numerous. As instances, I\\r\\nhave corresponded with Governor Seymour, but Not with Mayor Opdyke; with\\r\\nGovernor Curtin, but not with Mayor Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

In the meantime let me urge that you do\\r\\nyour utmost to get every man you can, black and white, under arms at the\\r\\nvery earliest moment, to guard roads, bridges, and trains, allowing all\\r\\nthe better trained soldiers to go forward to Rosecrans.

I suppose it is proper for you to know this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GOVERNOR JOHNSON.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, SEPTEMBER, 11, 1863\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. ANDREW JOHNSON.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--All Tennessee is now clear of armed insurrectionists. You\\r\\nneed not to be reminded that it is the nick of time for reinaugurating\\r\\na loyal State government. Not a moment should be lost. You and the\\r\\nco-operating friends there can better judge of the ways and means than can\\r\\nbe judged by any here. I only offer a few suggestions. The reinauguration\\r\\nmust not be such as to give control of the State and its representation\\r\\nin Congress to the enemies of the Union, driving its friends there\\r\\ninto political exile. The whole struggle for Tennessee will have been\\r\\nprofitless to both State and nation if it so ends that Governor Johnson is\\r\\nput down and Governor Harris put up. It must not be so. You must have it\\r\\notherwise. Let the reconstruction be the work of such men only as can be\\r\\ntrusted for the Union. Exclude all others, and trust that your government\\r\\nso organized will be recognized here as being the one of republican form\\r\\nto be guaranteed to the State, and to be protected against invasion and\\r\\ndomestic violence. It is something on the question of time to remember\\r\\nthat it cannot be known who is next to occupy the position I now hold, nor\\r\\nwhat he will do. I see that you have declared in favor of emancipation\\r\\nin Tennessee, for which may God bless you. Get emancipation into your new\\r\\nState government constitution and there will be no such word as fail for\\r\\nyour cause. The raising of colored troops, I think, will greatly help\\r\\nevery way.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL A. E.

We cannot allow you to resign until things shall be a little more\\r\\nsettled in East Tennessee. If then, purely on your own account, you wish\\r\\nto resign, we will not further refuse you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

It is also said his\\r\\nsupposed desertion is comprised in an absence commencing with his falling\\r\\nbehind last winter, being captured and paroled by the enemy, and then\\r\\ngoing home.

The papers\\r\\nleft with me do not designate the regiment to which he belongs. The man\\r\\nwho gave me the papers, I do not know how to find again. He only told me\\r\\nthat Edds is in the Army of the Potomac, and that he fell out of the ranks\\r\\nduring Burnside\\'s mud march last winter.

ANDREW JOHNSON.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR SIR:--Herewith I send you a paper, substantially the same as the\\r\\none drawn up by yourself and mentioned in your despatch, but slightly\\r\\nchanged in two particulars: First, yours was so drawn as that I authorized\\r\\nyou to carry into effect the fourth section, etc., whereas I so modify\\r\\nit as to authorize you to so act as to require the United States to carry\\r\\ninto effect that section.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, you had a clause committing me in some sort to the State\\r\\nconstitution of Tennessee, which I feared might embarrass you in making a\\r\\nnew constitution, if you desire; so I dropped that clause.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours very truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Inclosure.]\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C.,\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 19, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. ANDREW JOHNSON, Military Governor of Tennessee:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the matters contained in the orders and instructions given\\r\\nyou by the Secretary of War, you are hereby authorized to exercise such\\r\\npowers as may be necessary and proper to enable the loyal people of\\r\\nTennessee to present such a republican form of State government as will\\r\\nentitle the State to the guaranty of the United States therefor, and to\\r\\nbe protected under such State government by the United States against\\r\\ninvasion and domestic violence, all according to the fourth Section of the\\r\\nfourth article of the Constitution of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMILITARY STRATEGY\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON D.C. September 19, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\\r\\n\\r\\nBy General Meade\\'s despatch to you of yesterday it appears that he desires\\r\\nyour views and those of the government as to whether he shall advance upon\\r\\nthe enemy. I am not prepared to order, or even advise, an advance in this\\r\\ncase, wherein I know so little of particulars, and wherein he, in the\\r\\nfield, thinks the risk is so great and the promise of advantage so small.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet the case presents matter for very serious consideration in\\r\\nanother aspect. These two armies confront each other across a small river,\\r\\nsubstantially midway between the two capitals, each defending its own\\r\\ncapital, and menacing the other. General Meade estimates the enemy\\'s\\r\\ninfantry in front of him at not less than 40,000. Suppose we add fifty per\\r\\ncent. to this for cavalry, artillery, and extra-duty men stretching as far\\r\\nas Richmond, making the whole force of the enemy 60,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Meade, as shown by the returns, has with him, and between him and\\r\\nWashington, of the same classes, of well men, over 90,000. Neither can\\r\\nbring the whole of his men into a battle; but each can bring as large a\\r\\npercentage in as the other. For a battle, then, General Meade has three\\r\\nmen to General Lee\\'s two. Yet, it having been determined that choosing\\r\\nground and standing on the defensive gives so great advantage that the\\r\\nthree cannot safely attack the two, the three are left simply standing on\\r\\nthe defensive also.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the enemy\\'s 60,000 are sufficient to keep our 90,000 away from\\r\\nRichmond, why, by the same rule, may not 40,000 of ours keep their 60,000\\r\\naway from Washington, leaving us 50,000 to put to some other use? Having\\r\\npractically come to the mere defensive, it seems to be no economy at all\\r\\nto employ twice as many men for that object as are needed. With no object,\\r\\ncertainly, to mislead myself, I can perceive no fault in this statement,\\r\\nunless we admit we are not the equal of the enemy, man for man. I hope you\\r\\nwill consider it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo avoid misunderstanding, let me say that to attempt to fight the enemy\\r\\nslowly back into his entrenchments at Richmond, and then to capture him,\\r\\nis an idea I have been trying to repudiate for quite a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy judgment is so clear against it that I would scarcely allow the attempt\\r\\nto be made if the general in command should desire to make it. My last\\r\\nattempt upon Richmond was to get McClellan, when he was nearer there\\r\\nthan the enemy was, to run in ahead of him. Since then I have constantly\\r\\ndesired the Army of the Potomac to make Lee\\'s army, and not Richmond, its\\r\\nobjective point. If our army cannot fall upon the enemy and hurt him where\\r\\nhe is, it is plain to me it can gain nothing by attempting to follow him\\r\\nover a succession of intrenched lines into a fortified city.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., September 20, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMRS. A. LINCOLN, New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nI neither see nor hear anything of sickness here now, though there may\\r\\nbe much without my knowing it.

Nothing very particular, but I would be glad to see you\\r\\nand Tad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, D. C., September 21, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\\r\\n\\r\\nI think it very important for General Rosecrans to hold his position at\\r\\nor about Chattanooga, because if held from that place to Cleveland, both\\r\\ninclusive, it keeps all Tennessee clear of the enemy, and also breaks one\\r\\nof his most important railroad lines. To prevent these consequences is so\\r\\nvital to his cause that he cannot give up the effort to dislodge us from\\r\\nthe position, thus bringing him to us and saving us the labor, expense,\\r\\nand hazard of going farther to find him, and also giving us the advantage\\r\\nof choosing our own ground and preparing it to fight him upon. The details\\r\\nmust, of course, be left to General Rosecrans, while we must furnish him\\r\\nthe means to the utmost of our ability. If you concur, I think he would\\r\\nbetter be informed that we are not pushing him beyond this position; and\\r\\nthat, in fact, our judgment is rather against his going beyond it. If he\\r\\ncan only maintain this position, without more, this rebellion can only eke\\r\\nout a short and feeble existence, as an animal sometimes may with a thorn\\r\\nin its vitals.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

We have unabated confidence in you, and in your soldiers\\r\\nand officers. In the main you must be the judge as to what is to be\\r\\ndone. If I were to suggest, I would say, save your army by taking strong\\r\\npositions until Burnside joins you, when, I hope, you can turn the tide. I\\r\\nthink you had better send a courier to Burnside to hurry him up. We\\r\\ncannot reach him by telegraph. We suppose some force is going to you from\\r\\nCorinth, but for want of communication we do not know how they are\\r\\ngetting along. We shall do our utmost to assist you.

LINCOLN, Fifth Avenue Hotel, New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe now have a tolerably accurate summing up of the late battle between\\r\\nRosecrans and Braag. The result is that we are worsted, if at all, only\\r\\nin the fact that we, after the main fighting was over, yielded the ground,\\r\\nthus leaving considerable of our artillery and wounded to fall into the\\r\\nenemy\\'s hands., for which we got nothing in turn. We lost in general\\r\\nofficers one killed and three or four wounded, all brigadiers, while,\\r\\naccording to the rebel accounts which we have, they lost six killed\\r\\nand eight wounded: of the killed one major-general and five brigadiers\\r\\nincluding your brother-in-law, Helm; and of the wounded three\\r\\nmajor-generals and five brigadiers. This list may be reduced two in number\\r\\nby corrections of confusion in names. At 11.40 A.M. yesterday General\\r\\nRosecrans telegraphed from Chattanooga: \"We hold this point, and I cannot\\r\\nbe dislodged except by very superior numbers and after a great battle.\" A\\r\\ndespatch leaving there after night yesterday says, \"No fight to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

SCHOFIELD:\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no organized military force in avowed opposition to the General\\r\\nGovernment now in Missouri, and if any shall reappear, your duty in regard\\r\\nto it will be too plain to require any special instruction. Still, the\\r\\ncondition of things, both there and elsewhere, is such as to render\\r\\nit indispensable to maintain, for a time, the United States military\\r\\nestablishment in that State, as well as to rely upon it for a fair\\r\\ncontribution of support to that establishment generally. Your immediate\\r\\nduty in regard to Missouri now is to advance the efficiency of that\\r\\nestablishment, and to so use it, as far as practicable, to compel the\\r\\nexcited people there to let one another alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder your recent order, which I have approved, you will only arrest\\r\\nindividuals, and suppress assemblies or newspapers, when they may be\\r\\nworking palpable injury to the military in your charge; and in no other\\r\\ncase will you interfere with the expression of opinion in any form, or\\r\\nallow it to be interfered with violently by others. In this you have a\\r\\ndiscretion to exercise with great caution, calmness, and forbearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the matter of removing the inhabitants of certain counties en masse,\\r\\nand of removing certain individuals from time to time, who are supposed\\r\\nto be mischievous, I am not now interfering, but am leaving to your own\\r\\ndiscretion.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor am I interfering with what may still seem to you to be necessary\\r\\nrestrictions upon trade and intercourse. I think proper, however, to\\r\\nenjoin upon you the following: Allow no part of the military under your\\r\\ncommand to be engaged in either returning fugitive slaves or in forcing or\\r\\nenticing slaves from their homes; and, so far as practicable, enforce the\\r\\nsame forbearance upon the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nReport to me your opinion upon the availability for good of the enrolled\\r\\nmilitia of the State. Allow no one to enlist colored troops, except upon\\r\\norders from you, or from here through you.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllow no one to assume the functions of confiscating property, under the\\r\\nlaw of Congress, or otherwise, except upon orders from here.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt elections see that those, and only those, are allowed to vote who are\\r\\nentitled to do so by the laws of Missouri, including as of those laws\\r\\nthe restrictions laid by the Missouri convention upon those who may have\\r\\nparticipated in the rebellion.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far as practicable, you will, by means of your military force, expel\\r\\nguerrillas, marauders, and murderers, and all who are known to harbor,\\r\\naid, or abet them. But in like manner you will repress assumptions of\\r\\nunauthorized individuals to perform the same service, because under\\r\\npretense of doing this they become marauders and murderers themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo now restore peace, let the military obey orders, and those not of the\\r\\nmilitary leave each other alone, thus not breaking the peace themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn giving the above directions, it is not intended to restrain you in\\r\\nother expedient and necessary matters not falling within their range.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour obedient servant,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

To these bounties, which\\r\\nare so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from\\r\\nwhich they come, others have been added which are of so extraordinary a\\r\\nnature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which\\r\\nis habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God.\\r\\nIn the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity which has\\r\\nsometimes seemed to invite and provoke the aggressions of foreign states;\\r\\npeace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the\\r\\nlaws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere\\r\\nexcept in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been\\r\\ngreatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union. The\\r\\nneedful diversion of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful\\r\\nindustry, to the national defense has not arrested the plough, the\\r\\nshuttle, or the ship: The axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements,\\r\\nand the mines, as well of, iron and coal as of the precious metals, have\\r\\nyielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily\\r\\nincreased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp,\\r\\nthe siege, and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in the\\r\\nconsciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect a\\r\\ncontinuance of years, with large increase of freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal hand worked out these\\r\\ngreat things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while\\r\\ndealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be reverently,\\r\\nsolemnly, and gratefully acknowledged, as with one heart and voice, by the\\r\\nwhole American people. I do, therefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every\\r\\npart of the United States, and also those who are at sea, and those\\r\\nwho are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last\\r\\nThursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving and prayer to our\\r\\nbeneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens. And I recommend to them\\r\\nthat, while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such\\r\\nsingular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence\\r\\nfor our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care\\r\\nall those who have become widows, orphans, mourners, or sufferers in the\\r\\nlamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently\\r\\nimplore the interposition of the Almighty hand to heal the wounds of\\r\\nthe nation, and to restore it, as soon as may be consistent with divine\\r\\npurposes, to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity, and\\r\\nunion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\\r\\nthe United States to be affixed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDone at the city of Washington, this third day of October, in the year\\r\\nof our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the\\r\\nindependence of the United States the eighty-eighth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\\r\\n  Secretary of State\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD.\\r\\n\\r\\nWASHINGTON D.C., OCTOBER 4, 1863\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL SCHOFIELD, St. Louis, Mo.:\\r\\n\\r\\nI think you will not have just cause to complain of my action.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR DEPARTMENT, October 4, 1863. 11.30 A.M.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Chattanooga, Tenn.:\\r\\n\\r\\nYours of yesterday received. If we can hold Chattanooga and East\\r\\nTennessee, I think the rebellion must dwindle and die. I think you and\\r\\nBurnside can do this, and hence doing so is your main object. Of course\\r\\nto greatly damage or destroy the enemy in your front would be a greater\\r\\nobject, because it would include the former and more, but it is not so\\r\\ncertainly within your power. I understand the main body of the enemy is\\r\\nvery near you, so near that you could \"board at home,\" so to speak, and\\r\\nmenace or attack him any day. Would not the doing of this be your best\\r\\nmode of counteracting his raid on your communications? But this is not an\\r\\norder. I intend doing something like what you suggest whenever the case\\r\\nshall appear ripe enough to have it accepted in the true understanding\\r\\nrather than as a confession of weakness and fear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO C. D. DRAKE AND OTHERS.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 5, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHON. CHARLES D. DRAKE AND OTHERS, Committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEMEN:-Your original address, presented on the 30th ult., and the\\r\\nfour supplementary ones presented on the 3d inst., have been carefully\\r\\nconsidered. I hope you will regard the other duties claiming my attention,\\r\\ntogether with the great length and importance of these documents, as\\r\\nconstituting a sufficient apology for not having responded sooner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese papers, framed for a common object, consist of the things demanded\\r\\nand the reasons for demanding them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe things demanded are\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst. That General Schofield shall be relieved, and General Butler be\\r\\nappointed as Commander of the Military Department of Missouri.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond. That the system of enrolled militia in Missouri may be broken up,\\r\\nand national forces he substituted for it; and\\r\\n\\r\\nThird. That at elections persons may not be allowed to vote who are not\\r\\nentitled by law to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the reasons given, enough of suffering and wrong to Union men is\\r\\ncertainly, and I suppose truly, stated. Yet the whole case, as presented,\\r\\nfails to convince me that General Schofield, or the enrolled militia, is\\r\\nresponsible for that suffering and wrong. The whole can be explained on a\\r\\nmore charitable, and, as I think, a more rational hypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are in a civil war. In such cases there always is a main question, but\\r\\nin this case that question is a perplexing compound--Union and slavery.\\r\\nIt thus becomes a question not of two sides merely, but of at least four\\r\\nsides, even among those who are for the Union, saying nothing of those who\\r\\nare against it. Thus, those who are for the Union with, but not without\\r\\nslavery; those for it without, but not with; those for it with or without,\\r\\nbut prefer it with; and those for it with or without, but prefer it\\r\\nwithout.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong these, again, is a subdivision of those who are for gradual, but\\r\\nnot for immediate, and those who are for immediate, but not for gradual\\r\\nextinction of slavery.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is easy to conceive that all these shades of opinion, and even more,\\r\\nmay be sincerely entertained by honest and truthful men. Yet, all being\\r\\nfor the Union, by reason of these differences each will prefer a different\\r\\nway of sustaining the Union. At once, sincerity is questioned, and motives\\r\\nare assailed. Actual war comming, blood grows hot and blood is spilled.\\r\\nThought is forced from old channels into confusion. Deception breeds and\\r\\nthrives. Confidence dies, and universal suspicion reigns. Each man feels\\r\\nan impulse to kill his neighbor, lest he be killed by him. Revenge and\\r\\nretaliation follow. And all this, as before said, may be among honest men\\r\\nonly. But this is not all. Every foul bird comes abroad, and every dirty\\r\\nreptile rises up. These add crime to confusion. Strong measures\\r\\ndeemed indispensable, but harsh at best, such men make worse by\\r\\nmaladministration. Murders for old grudges, and murders for self, proceed\\r\\nunder any cloak that will best serve for the occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese causes amply account for what has occurred in Missouri, without\\r\\nascribing it to the weakness or wickedness of any general. The newspaper\\r\\nfiles, those chroniclers of current events, will show that the evils now\\r\\ncomplained of were quite as prevalent under Fremont, Hunter, Halleck, and\\r\\nCurtis, as under Schofield. If the former had greater force opposed\\r\\nto them, they also had greater force with which to meet it. When the\\r\\norganized rebel army left the State, the main Federal force had to go\\r\\nalso, leaving the department commander at home relatively no stronger\\r\\nthan before. Without disparaging any, I affirm with confidence that no\\r\\ncommander of that department has, in proportion to his means, done better\\r\\nthan General Schofield.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first specific charge against General Schofield is, that the enrolled\\r\\nmilitia was placed under his command, whereas it had not been placed under\\r\\nthe command of General Curtis. The fact is, I believe, true; but you do\\r\\nnot point out, nor can I conceive, how that did, or could, injure loyal\\r\\nmen or the Union cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou charge that, General Curtis being superseded by General Schofield,\\r\\nFranklin A. Dick was superseded by James O. Broadhead as Provost-Marshal\\r\\nGeneral. No very specific showing is made as to how this did or could\\r\\ninjure the Union cause. It recalls, however, the condition of things, as\\r\\npresented to me, which led to a change of commander of that department.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo restrain contraband intelligence and trade, a system of searches,\\r\\nseizures, permits, and passes, had been introduced, I think, by General\\r\\nFremont. When General Halleck came, he found and continued the system, and\\r\\nadded an order, applicable to some parts of the State, to levy and\\r\\ncollect contributions from noted rebels, to compensate losses and relieve\\r\\ndestitution caused by the rebellion. The action of General Fremont and\\r\\nGeneral Halleck, as stated, constituted a sort of system which General\\r\\nCurtis found in full operation when he took command of the department.\\r\\nThat there was a necessity for something of the sort was clear; but that\\r\\nit could only be justified by stern necessity, and that it was liable to\\r\\ngreat abuse in administration, was equally clear. Agents to execute it,\\r\\ncontrary to the great prayer, were led into temptation. Some might, while\\r\\nothers would not, resist that temptation. It was not possible to hold\\r\\nany to a very strict accountability; and those yielding to the temptation\\r\\nwould sell permits and passes to those who would pay most and most readily\\r\\nfor them, and would seize property and collect levies in the aptest way\\r\\nto fill their own pockets. Money being the object, the man having money,\\r\\nwhether loyal or disloyal, would be a victim. This practice doubtless\\r\\nexisted to some extent, and it was, a real additional evil that it could\\r\\nbe, and was, plausibly charged to exist in greater extent than it did.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen General Curtis took command of the department, Mr. Dick, against\\r\\nwhom I never knew anything to allege, had general charge of this system.\\r\\nA controversy in regard to it rapidly grew into almost unmanageable\\r\\nproportions. One side ignored the necessity and magnified the evils of the\\r\\nsystem, while the other ignored the evils and magnified the necessity;\\r\\nand each bitterly assailed the other. I could not fail to see that the\\r\\ncontroversy enlarged in the same proportion as the professed Union men\\r\\nthere distinctly took sides in two opposing political parties. I exhausted\\r\\nmy wits, and very nearly my patience also, in efforts to convince both\\r\\nthat the evils they charged on each other were inherent in the case, and\\r\\ncould not be cured by giving either party a victory over the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlainly, the irritating system was not to be perpetual; and it was\\r\\nplausibly urged that it could be modified at once with advantage. The case\\r\\ncould scarcely be worse, and whether it could be made better could only\\r\\nbe determined by a trial. In this view, and not to ban or brand General\\r\\nCurtis, or to give a victory to any party, I made the change of commander\\r\\nfor the department. I now learn that soon after this change Mr. Dick was\\r\\nremoved, and that Mr. Broadhead, a gentleman of no less good character,\\r\\nwas put in the place. The mere fact of this change is more distinctly\\r\\ncomplained of than is any conduct of the new officer, or other consequence\\r\\nof the change.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave the new commander no instructions as to the administration of\\r\\nthe system mentioned, beyond what is contained in the private letter\\r\\nafterwards surreptitiously published, in which I directed him to act\\r\\nsolely for the public good, and independently of both parties. Neither any\\r\\nthing you have presented me, nor anything I have otherwise learned, has\\r\\nconvinced me that he has been unfaithful to this charge.\\r\\n\\r\\nImbecility is urged as one cause for removing General Schofield; and\\r\\nthe late massacre at Lawrence, Kansas, is pressed as evidence of that\\r\\nimbecility. To my mind that fact scarcely tends to prove the proposition.\\r\\nThat massacre is only an example of what Grierson, John Morgan, and many\\r\\nothers might have repeatedly done on their respective raids, had they\\r\\nchosen to incur the personal hazard, and possessed the fiendish hearts to\\r\\ndo it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe charge is made that General Schofield, on purpose to protect the\\r\\nLawrence murderers, would not allow them to be pursued into Missouri.\\r\\nWhile no punishment could be too sudden or too severe for those murderers,\\r\\nI am well satisfied that the preventing of the threatened remedial raid\\r\\ninto Missouri was the only way to avoid an indiscriminate massacre there,\\r\\nincluding probably more innocent than guilty. Instead of condemning, I\\r\\ntherefore approve what I understand General Schofield did in that respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe charges that General Schofield has purposely withheld protection from\\r\\nloyal people and purposely facilitated the objects of the disloyal are\\r\\naltogether beyond my power of belief. I do not arraign the veracity of\\r\\ngentlemen as to the facts complained of, but I do more than question the\\r\\njudgment which would infer that those facts occurred in accordance with\\r\\nthe purposes of General Schofield.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith my present views, I must decline to remove General Schofield. In\\r\\nthis I decide nothing against General Butler. I sincerely wish it were\\r\\nconvenient to assign him a suitable command. In order to meet some\\r\\nexisting evils I have addressed a letter of instructions to General\\r\\nSchofield, a copy of which I enclose to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the enrolled militia, I shall endeavor to ascertain better than\\r\\nI now know what is its exact value. Let me say now, however, that your\\r\\nproposal to substitute national forces for the enrolled militia implies\\r\\nthat in your judgment the latter is doing something which needs to be\\r\\ndone; and if so, the proposition to throw that force away and to supply\\r\\nits place by bringing other forces from the field where they are urgently\\r\\nneeded seems to me very extraordinary. Whence shall they come? Shall they\\r\\nbe withdrawn from Banks, or Grant, or Steele, or Rosecrans? Few things\\r\\nhave been so grateful to my anxious feelings as when, in June last, the\\r\\nlocal force in Missouri aided General Schofield to so promptly send\\r\\na large general force to the relief of General Grant, then investing\\r\\nVicksburg and menaced from without by General Johnston. Was this all\\r\\nwrong? Should the enrolled militia then have been broken up and General\\r\\nHerron kept from Grant to police Missouri? So far from finding cause to\\r\\nobject, I confess to a sympathy for whatever relieves our general force\\r\\nin Missouri and allows it to serve elsewhere. I therefore, as at present\\r\\nadvised, cannot attempt the destruction of the enrolled militia of\\r\\nMissouri. I may add that, the force being under the national military\\r\\ncontrol, it is also within the proclamation in regard to the habeas\\r\\ncorpus.\\r\\n\\r\\nI concur in the propriety of your request in regard to elections, and\\r\\nhave, as you see, directed General Schofield accordingly. I do not feel\\r\\njustified to enter upon the broad field you present in regard to the\\r\\npolitical differences between Radicals and Conservatives. From time to\\r\\ntime I have done and said what appeared to me proper to do and say.\\r\\nThe public knows it all. It obliges nobody to follow me, and I trust it\\r\\nobliges me to follow nobody. The Radicals and Conservatives each agree\\r\\nwith me in some things and disagree in others. I could wish both to agree\\r\\nwith me in all things, for then they would agree with each other, and\\r\\nwould be too strong for any foe from any quarter. They, however, choose to\\r\\ndo otherwise; and I do not question their right. I too shall do what\\r\\nseems to be my duty. I hold whoever commands in Missouri or elsewhere\\r\\nresponsible to me and not to either Radicals or Conservatives. It is my\\r\\nduty to hear all, but at last I must, within my sphere, judge what to do\\r\\nand what to forbear.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour obedient servant,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

The following are his remarks on the case:\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the presentation of the record in this case and the examination\\r\\nthereof, aided by the report thereon of the Judge-Advocate-General, and\\r\\non full hearing of counsel for the accused, being specified that no proper\\r\\nquestion remained open except as to the sanity of the accused, I caused a\\r\\nvery full examination to be made on that question, upon a great amount of\\r\\nevidence, including all effort by the counsel for accused, by an expert\\r\\nof high reputation in that professional department, who thereon reports to\\r\\nme, as his opinion, that the accused, Dr. David M. Wright, was not insane\\r\\nprior to or on the 11th day of July, 1863, the date of the homicide of\\r\\nLieutenant Sanborn; that he has not been insane since, and is not insane\\r\\nnow (Oct. 7, 1863). I therefore approve the finding and sentence of the\\r\\nmilitary commission, and direct that the major-general in command of the\\r\\ndepartment including the place of trial, and wherein the convict is now in\\r\\ncustody, appoint a time and place and carry such sentence into execution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

TAYLOR, Knoxville, Tenn.:\\r\\n\\r\\nYou do not estimate the holding of East Tennessee more highly than I do.\\r\\nThere is no absolute purpose of withdrawing our forces from it, and only a\\r\\ncontingent one to withdraw them temporarily for the purpose of not losing\\r\\nthe position permanently.

I suppose what you have\\r\\nheard a rumor of was not a general battle, but an \"affair\" at Bristow\\r\\nStation on the railroad, a few miles beyond Manassas Junction toward the\\r\\nRappahannock, on Wednesday, the 14th. It began by an attack of the enemy\\r\\nupon General Warren, and ended in the enemy being repulsed with a loss of\\r\\nfour cannon and from four to seven hundred prisoners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

Have they been sent there by any order, and if so, for what\\r\\nreason?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL R. C.

The fact of one of our officers being killed on the\\r\\nPatuxent is a specimen of what I would avoid. It seems to me we could\\r\\nsend white men to recruit better than to send negroes and thus inaugurate\\r\\nhomicides on punctilio.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease come over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. LINCOLN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 24, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking all our information together, I think it probable that Ewell\\'s\\r\\ncorps has started for East Tennessee by way of Abingdon, marching\\r\\nlast Monday, say from Meade\\'s front directly to the railroad at\\r\\nCharlottesville.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, the object of Lee\\'s recent movement against Meade; his destruction\\r\\nof the Alexandria and Orange Railroad, and subsequent withdrawal\\r\\nwithout more motive, not otherwise apparent, would be explained by this\\r\\nhypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, the direct statement of Sharpe\\'s men that Ewell has gone to\\r\\nTennessee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirdly, the Irishman\\'s [Northern Spy in Richmond] statement that he has\\r\\nnot gone through Richmond, and his further statement of an appeal made\\r\\nto the people at Richmond to go and protect their salt, which could only\\r\\nrefer to the works near Abingdon.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourthly, Graham\\'s statement from Martinsburg that Imboden is in retreat\\r\\nfor Harrisonburg. This last matches with the idea that Lee has retained\\r\\nhis cavalry, sending Imboden and perhaps other scraps to join Ewell. Upon\\r\\nthis probability what is to be done?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have a plan matured, I have nothing to say. If you have not, then\\r\\nI suggest that, with all possible expedition, the Army of the Potomac\\r\\nget ready to attack Lee, and that in the meantime a raid shall, at all\\r\\nhazards, break the railroad at or near Lynchburg.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours truly,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA.

              "  '\\r\\nLIFE IN THE RED BRIGADE, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER ONE.\\r\\n\\r\\nWet, worn and weary--with water squeaking in his boots, and a mixture of\\r\\ncharcoal and water streaking his face to such an extent that, as a\\r\\ncomrade asserted, his own mother would not have known him--a stout young\\r\\nman walked smartly one morning through the streets of London towards his\\r\\nown home.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was tall and good-looking, as well as stout, and, although wet and\\r\\nweary, had a spring in his step which proved beyond all question that he\\r\\nwas not worn-out.  As the comrade above referred to would have said,\\r\\n\"there was plenty of go in him still.\"  His blue and belted coat,\\r\\nsailor\\'s cap, and small hatchet, with the brass helmet swinging by its\\r\\nchin strap on his left arm, betokened him a member of \"The Red\\r\\nBrigade,\"--a London fireman--one of those dare-anything characters who\\r\\nappear to hold their lives remarkably cheap, for they carry these lives\\r\\nin their hands, as the saying goes, night and day; who seem to be able\\r\\nto live in smoke as if it were their native element; who face the flames\\r\\nas if their bodies were made of cast iron; and whose apparent delight in\\r\\nfire is such that one is led to suspect they must be all more or less\\r\\ndistantly connected with the family of Salamander.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man\\'s expression of countenance, as far as it could be\\r\\ndiscerned through the charcoal and water, was hearty, and his name--\\r\\nDashwood--was in keeping with his profession.  The comrade, whose\\r\\nopinion we have already quoted, was wont to say that he ought to change\\r\\nit to Dashwater, that being his chief occupation in life.  We need\\r\\nscarcely say that this comrade was rather fond of his joke.\\r\\n\\r\\nArrived at a small street, not far from the Regent Circus, young\\r\\nDashwood entered a fire-station there, and found the comrade above\\r\\nreferred to in the act of disposing himself on a narrow tressel-bed, on\\r\\nwhich there was no bedding save one blanket.  The comrade happened to be\\r\\non duty that night.  It was his duty to repose on the tressel-bedstead,\\r\\nbooted and belted, ready at a moment\\'s notice to respond to \"calls.\"\\r\\nAnother fireman lay sleeping at his side, on another tressel-bed,\\r\\nsimilarly clothed, for there were always two men on duty all night at\\r\\nthat station.  The guard-room, or, as it was styled, the \"lobby,\" in\\r\\nwhich they lay, was a very small room, with a bright fire in the grate,\\r\\nfor it was winter; a plain wooden desk near the window; a plain deal\\r\\ntable near the door, on which stood four telegraphic instruments; and\\r\\nhaving the walls ornamented with a row of Wellington boots on one side,\\r\\nand a row of bright brass helmets on the other, each helmet having a\\r\\nsmall hatchet suspended by a belt below it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe comrade, who looked very sleepy, glanced at a small clock, whose\\r\\ntick was the only sound that fell upon the ear, and whose hands\\r\\nindicated the hour of half-past two.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn hearing the door open, the comrade, whose name was Bob Clazie, raised\\r\\nhimself on one elbow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, Joe,--that you?\" he said, with a somewhat violent yawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All that\\'s left of me, anyhow,\" replied Joe Dashwood, as he hung up his\\r\\nhelmet and axe on his own particular peg.  \"Bin much doin\\', Bob?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not much,\" growled Bob; \"but they don\\'t give a poor fellow much chance\\r\\nof a sleep with them telegraphs.  Roused me four times already within\\r\\nthe last hour--stops for chimbleys.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! very inconsiderate of \\'em,\" said Dashwood, turning towards the\\r\\ndoor.  \"It\\'s time I had a snooze now, so I\\'ll bid \\'ee good night, Bob.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as he spoke, one of the sharp little telegraphic bells rang\\r\\nviciously.  He waited to ascertain the result while Clazie rose--quickly\\r\\nbut not hurriedly--and went to read the instrument with sleepy eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another stop for a chimbley,\" he muttered, with a remonstrative growl.\\r\\nBy this he meant that the head office in Watling Street had telegraphed\\r\\nthat a chimney had gone on fire in some part of London; that it was\\r\\nbeing looked after, and that he and his comrades were to _stop_ where\\r\\nthey were and pay no attention to it, even although some one should rush\\r\\ninto the office like a maniac shouting that there was a fire in that\\r\\nparticular place.  This use of the telegraph in thus _stopping_ the men\\r\\nof the Brigade from going out in force to trifling fires, is of the\\r\\ngreatest service, because it not only prevents them from being harassed,\\r\\nthe engines from being horsed, and steam got up needlessly, but it\\r\\nprevents rascals from running from station to station, and getting\\r\\nseveral shillings, instead of the one shilling which is due to the first\\r\\nintimator of any fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving acknowledged the message, Bob Clazie lay down once more, gave\\r\\nanother expostulatory grunt, and drew his blanket over him; while Joe\\r\\nDashwood went home.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe\\'s home consisted of a small apartment round the corner of the\\r\\nstreet, within a few seconds\\' run of the station.  Off the small\\r\\napartment there was a large closet.  The small apartment was Dashwood\\'s\\r\\ndrawing-room, dining-room, and kitchen; the large closet was his\\r\\nbed-room.\\r\\n\\r\\nDashwood had a wife, \"as tight a little craft, with as pretty a\\r\\nfigurehead,\" he was wont to say, \"as you could find in a day\\'s walk\\r\\nthrough London.\"  That was saying a good deal, but there was some truth\\r\\nin it.  When Joe entered, intending to go to bed for the night, he found\\r\\nthat Mary had just got up for the day.  It was \"washing-day,\" or\\r\\nsomething of that sort, with Mary, which accounted for her getting up at\\r\\nabout three in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hallo, lass, up already!\" exclaimed the strapping fireman as he entered\\r\\nthe room, which was a perfect marvel of tidiness, despite washing-day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Joe, there\\'s plenty to do, an\\' little May don\\'t give me much time\\r\\nto do it,\" replied Mary, glancing at a crib where little May, their\\r\\nfirst-born, lay coiled up in sheets like a rosebud in snow.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe, having rubbed the water and charcoal from his face with a huge\\r\\njack-towel, went to the wash-tub, and imprinted a hearty kiss on Mary\\'s\\r\\nrosy lips, which she considerately held up for the purpose of being\\r\\nsaluted.  He was about to do the same to the rosebud, when Mary stopped\\r\\nhim with an energetic \"Don\\'t!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"W\\'y not, Molly?\" asked the obedient man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Cause you\\'ll wake her up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus put down, Joe seated himself humbly on a sea-chest, and began to\\r\\npull off his wet boots.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s bin a bad fire, I think,\" said Mary, glancing at her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rather.  A beer-shop in Whitechapel.  House of five rooms burnt out,\\r\\nand the roof off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You look tired, Joe,\" said Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I _am_ a bit tired, but an hour\\'s rest will put me all to rights.\\r\\nThat\\'s the third fire I\\'ve bin called to to-night; not that I think much\\r\\nabout that, but the last one has bin a stiff one, an\\' I got a fall or\\r\\ntwo that nigh shook the wind out o\\' me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have something to eat, Joe,\" said Mary, in a sympathetic tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No thankee, lass; I need sleep more than meat just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A glass of beer, then,\" urged Mary, sweeping the soap suds off her\\r\\npretty arms and hands, and taking up a towel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fireman shook his head, as he divested himself of his coat and\\r\\nneckcloth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do, Joe,\" entreated Mary; \"I\\'m sure it will do you good, and no one\\r\\ncould say that you broke through your principles, considerin\\' the\\r\\ncondition you\\'re in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFoolish Mary! she was young and inexperienced, and knew not the danger\\r\\nof tempting her husband to drink.  She only knew that hundreds of\\r\\nfirst-rate, sober, good, trustworthy men took a glass of beer now and\\r\\nthen without any evil result following, and did not think that her Joe\\r\\nran the slightest risk in doing the same.  But Joe knew his danger.  His\\r\\nfather had died a drunkard.  He had listened to earnest men while they\\r\\ntold of the bitter curse that drinking had been to thousands, that to\\r\\nsome extent the tendency to drink was hereditary, and that, however safe\\r\\nsome natures might be while moderately indulging, there were other\\r\\nnatures to which moderate drinking was equivalent to getting on those\\r\\nrails which, running down a slight incline at first--almost a level--\\r\\ngradually pass over a steep descent, where brakes become powerless, and\\r\\nend at last in total destruction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t require beer, Molly,\" said Dashwood with a smile, as he retired\\r\\ninto the large closet; \"at my time o\\' life a man must be a miserable,\\r\\nhalf-alive sort o\\' critter, if he can\\'t git along without Dutch courage.\\r\\nThe sight o\\' your face and May\\'s there, is better than a stiff glass o\\'\\r\\ngrog to me any day.  It makes me feel stronger than the stoutest man in\\r\\nthe brigade.  Good night, lass, or good mornin\\'.  I must make the most\\r\\no\\' my time.  There\\'s no sayin\\' how soon the next call may come.  Seems\\r\\nto me as if people was settin\\' their houses alight on purpose to worry\\r\\nus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tones in which the last sentences were uttered, and the creaking of\\r\\nthe bedstead indicated that the fireman was composing his massive limbs\\r\\nto rest, and scarcely had Mrs Dashwood resumed her washing, when his\\r\\nregular heavy breathing proclaimed him to be already in the land of Nod.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuietly but steadily did Mrs Dashwood pursue her work.  Neat little\\r\\nunder-garments, and fairy-like little socks, and indescribable little\\r\\narticles of Lilliputian clothing of various kinds, all telling of the\\r\\nlittle rosebud in the crib, passed rapidly through Mary\\'s nimble\\r\\nfingers, and came out of the tub fair as the driven snow.  Soon the\\r\\nfront of the fire-place became like a ship dressed with flags, with this\\r\\ndifference, that the flags instead of being gay and parti-coloured, were\\r\\nwhite and suggestive of infancy and innocence.  The gentle noise of\\r\\nwashing, and the soft breathing of the sleepers, and the tiny ticking of\\r\\nthe clock over the chimney-piece, were the only audible sounds, for\\r\\nLondon had reached its deadest hour, four o\\'clock.  Rioters had\\r\\nexhausted their spirits, natural and artificial, and early risers had\\r\\nnot begun to move.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently to these sounds were added another very distant sound which\\r\\ninduced Mary to stop and listen.  \"A late cab,\" she whispered to\\r\\nherself.  The rumbling of the late cab became more distinct, and soon\\r\\nproved it to be a hurried cab.  To Mary\\'s accustomed ear this raised\\r\\nsome disagreeable idea.  She cast a look of anxiety into the closet,\\r\\nwiped her hands quickly, and taking up a pair of dry boots which had\\r\\nbeen standing near the fire, placed them beside her husband\\'s coat.\\r\\nThis was barely accomplished when the hurried cab was heard to pull up\\r\\nat the neighbouring fire-station.  Only a few seconds elapsed when\\r\\nracing footsteps were heard outside.  Mary seized her husband\\'s arm--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Up, Joe, up,\" she cried and darted across the room, leaped on a chair,\\r\\nand laid violent hands on the tongue of the door-bell, thereby\\r\\npreventing a furious double ring from disturbing the rosebud!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the first word \"up,\" the bed in the closet groaned and creaked as the\\r\\nfireman bounded from it, and the house shook as he alighted on the\\r\\nfloor.  Next moment he appeared buttoning his braces, and winking like\\r\\nan owl in sunshine.  One moment sufficed to pull on the right boot,\\r\\nanother moment affixed the left.  Catching up his half-dried coat with\\r\\none hand, and flinging on his sailor\\'s cap with the other, he darted\\r\\nfrom the house, thrust himself into his coat as he ran along and\\r\\nappeared at the station just as four of his comrades drew the\\r\\nfire-engine up to the door, while two others appeared with three horses,\\r\\nwhich they harnessed thereto--two abreast, one in front--with marvellous\\r\\nrapidity.  The whole affair, from the \"Up, Joe, up,\" of Mrs Dashwood,\\r\\nto the harnessing of the steeds, was accomplished in less than five\\r\\nminutes.  By that time Joe and several of his mates stood ready belted,\\r\\nand armed with brass helmets on their heads, which flashed back the rays\\r\\nof the neighbouring street lamp and the engine lanterns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was wonderfully little noise or fuss, although there was so much\\r\\ndisplay of promptitude and energy; the reason being that all the men\\r\\nwere thoroughly drilled, and each had his particular duty to perform;\\r\\nthere was, therefore, no room for orders, counter-orders, or confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moment the call was given, Bob Clazie, having received no\\r\\ntelegraphic \"stop,\" had at once run to ring up the men, who, like\\r\\nDashwood, had been sleeping close at hand.  He rang up the driver of the\\r\\nengine first.  At the same moment his comrade on duty had run round to\\r\\nthe stable, where the horses stood ready harnessed, and brought them\\r\\nout.  Thus the thing was done without a moment\\'s delay.  The driver,\\r\\nwhen roused, flung on his coat and helmet, and ran to the engine.  It\\r\\nwas a steam fire-engine; that is, the pumps were worked by steam instead\\r\\nof by hand.  The firing was ready laid, and the water kept nearly at the\\r\\nboiling point by means of a jet of gas.  He had scarcely applied a light\\r\\nto the fire and turned off the gas, when four comrades ran into the\\r\\nshed, seized the red-painted engine, and dragged her out, as we have\\r\\nseen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch shorter time did it take to do all this than is required to\\r\\ndescribe it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the driver mounted his box, the others sprang on the engine.\\r\\nCrack! went the whip, fire flew from the paving-stones, fire poured from\\r\\nthe furnace, the spirited steeds tore round the corner into Regent\\r\\nStreet, and off they went to the fire, in the dark winter morning, like\\r\\na monster rocket or a vision of Roman gladiators whirled away by a red\\r\\nfiery dragon!\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Dashwood heard them go, and turned with a little sigh to her\\r\\nwashing-tub.  She was very proud of Joe, and she had good reason to be,\\r\\nfor he was one of the best men in the Red Brigade, and, what was of more\\r\\nimportance to her, he was one of the best husbands in the world.\\r\\nPerhaps this was largely owing to the fact that she was one of the best\\r\\nof wives!  His career as a fireman had been short, but he had already\\r\\nbecome known as one of the daring men, to whom their Chief looked when\\r\\nsome desperate service had to be performed.  On several occasions he\\r\\nhad, while in charge of the fire-escape, been the means of saving life.\\r\\nUpon the whole, therefore, it is not surprising that Mary was proud of\\r\\nher husband--almost as proud of him as she was of the little rosebud;\\r\\nbut in regard to this she was never quite sure of the exact state of her\\r\\nmind.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeditating on Joe, and giving an occasional glance at May, whose sweet\\r\\nupturned face seemed nothing short of angelic, Mrs Dashwood continued\\r\\nenergetically to scrub the fairy-like habiliments, and make the soapsuds\\r\\nfly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the red engine whirled along its fiery course at full gallop,\\r\\nlike a horrible meteor, clattering loudly in the deserted streets of the\\r\\ngreat city.  So it would have sped in its wild career even if it had\\r\\nbeen broad day, for the loss of a single moment in reaching a fire is\\r\\nimportant; but in this case the men, instead of sitting like\\r\\nbrazen-headed statues, would have stood up and increased the din of\\r\\ntheir progress by shouting continuously to clear the crowded\\r\\nthoroughfares.  As it was, they had it all to themselves.  Sometimes the\\r\\ncorner of a window-blind was hastily lifted, showing that some wakeful\\r\\none had curiosity enough to leap out of bed to see them pass.  Here and\\r\\nthere a policeman paused, and followed them with his eye as long as the\\r\\ntail of sparks from the furnace was visible.  Occasionally a belated\\r\\ntoper stopped in his staggering progress to gaze at them, with an\\r\\nidiotical assumption of seriousness and demand, \"Wash ey maki\\'n sh\\' a\\r\\n\\'orrible row for?\"  Now and then a cat, with exploratory tendencies, put\\r\\nup its back and greeted them with a glare and a fuff, or a shut-out cur\\r\\ngave them a yelping salute; but the great mass of the London population\\r\\nlet them go by without notice, as they would have treated any other\\r\\npassing thunderbolt with which they had nothing to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet they _had_ something to do with that engine, or, rather, it had\\r\\nto do with them.  But for it, and the rest of the Red Brigade, London\\r\\nwould have long ago been in ashes.  It is only by unremitting vigilance\\r\\nand incessant action that the London fires can be kept within bounds.\\r\\nThere are nearly two thousand fires in the year in the metropolis, and\\r\\nthe heroic little army which keeps these in check numbers only three\\r\\nhundred and seventy-eight men.  That this force is much too small for\\r\\nthe work to be done is proved by the fact, that the same men have\\r\\nsometimes to turn out three, four or five times in a night, to work of\\r\\nthe most trying and dangerous nature.  There is no occupation in which\\r\\nthe lives of the men employed are so frequently risked, and their\\r\\nphysical endurance so severely tried, as that of a London fireman.  As\\r\\nthere are, on the average, five fires every night all the year round, it\\r\\nfollows that he is liable to be called out several times every night;\\r\\nand, in point of fact, this actually takes place very often.  Sometimes\\r\\nhe has barely returned from a fire, and put off his drenched garments,\\r\\nwhen he receives another \"call,\" and is obliged to put them on again,\\r\\nand go forth weary--it may be fasting--to engage in another skirmish\\r\\nwith the flames.  In all weathers and at all seasons--hot or cold, wet\\r\\nor dry--he must turn out at a moment\\'s notice, to find himself, almost\\r\\nbefore he is well awake, in the midst of stifling smoke, obliged to face\\r\\nand to endure the power of roasting flames, to stand under cataracts of\\r\\nwater, beside tottering walls and gables, or to plunge through smoke and\\r\\nflames, in order to rescue human lives.  Liability to be called\\r\\n_occasionally_ to the exercise of such courage and endurance is severe\\r\\nenough; it is what every soldier is liable to in time of war, and the\\r\\nlifeboat-man in times of storm; but to be liable to such calls several\\r\\ntimes every day and night all round the year is hard indeed, and proves\\r\\nthat the Red Brigade, although almost perfect in its organisation and\\r\\nheroic in its elements, is far too small.  Paris has about seven hundred\\r\\nfires a year; New York somewhere about three hundred; yet these cities\\r\\nhave a far larger body of firemen than London, which with little short\\r\\nof two thousand fires a year, does her work of extinction with only\\r\\nthree hundred and seventy-eight men!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe succeeds because every man in the little army is a hero, not one\\r\\nwhit behind the Spartans of old.  The London fireman, Ford, who, in\\r\\n1871, at one great fire rescued six lives from the flames, and perished\\r\\nin accomplishing the noble deed, is a sample of the rest.  All the men\\r\\nof the Brigade are picked men--picked from among the strapping and\\r\\nyouthful tars of the navy, because such men are accustomed to strict\\r\\ndiscipline; to being \"turned out\" at all hours and in all weathers, and\\r\\nto climb with cool heads in trying circumstances, besides being, as a\\r\\nclass, pre-eminently noted for daring anything and sticking at nothing.\\r\\nSuch men are sure to do their work well, however hard; to do it without\\r\\ncomplaining, and to die, if need be, in the doing of it.  But ought they\\r\\nto be asked to sacrifice so much?  Surely Londoners would do well to\\r\\nmake that complaint, which the men will _never_ make, and insist on the\\r\\nforce being increased, not only for the sake of the men, but also for\\r\\nthe sake of themselves; for, although there _are_ three hundred and\\r\\nseventy-eight heroes who hold the fiery foe so well in check, there are\\r\\nlimits to heroic powers of action, and it stands to reason that double\\r\\nthe number would do it better.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we are wandering from our point.  The engine has been tearing all\\r\\nthis time at racing speed along the Bayswater Road.  It turns sharp\\r\\nround a corner near Notting Hill Gate--so sharp that the feat is\\r\\nperformed on the two off wheels, and draws from Bob Clazie the quiet\\r\\nremark, \"Pretty nigh on our beam-ends that time, Joe.\"  A light is now\\r\\nseen glaring in the sky over the house-tops; another moment, and the\\r\\nengine dashes into Ladbroke Square, where a splendid mansion is in a\\r\\nblaze, with the flames spouting from the windows of the second floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engine pulls up with a crash; the reeking horses are removed and led\\r\\naside.  \"Look alive, lads!\" is the only word uttered, and the helmeted\\r\\nheroes, knowing their work well, go into action with that cool\\r\\npromptitude which is more than half the battle in attacking the most\\r\\ndesperate odds or the fiercest foe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER TWO.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house on fire was, as we have said, an elegant mansion--one of those\\r\\nimposing edifices, with fresh paint outside, and splendid furniture\\r\\nwithin, which impress the beholder with the idea of a family in\\r\\nluxurious circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one could tell how the fire originated.  In the daily \"report\" of\\r\\nfires, made next day by the chief of the Red Brigade, wherein nine fires\\r\\nwere set down as having occurred within the twenty-four hours, the cause\\r\\nof this fire in Ladbroke Square was reported \"unknown.\"  Of the other\\r\\neight, the supposed causes were, in one case, \"escape of gas,\" in\\r\\nanother, \"paraffin-lamp upset,\" in another \"intoxication,\" in another,\\r\\n\"spark from fire,\" in another, \"candle,\" in another, \"children playing\\r\\nwith matches,\" and so on; but in this mansion none of these causes were\\r\\ndeemed probable.  The master of the house turned off the gas regularly\\r\\nevery night before going to bed, therefore it could not have been caused\\r\\nby escape of gas.  Paraffin-lamps were not used in the house.  Candles\\r\\nwere; but they were always carefully handled and guarded.  As to\\r\\nintoxication, the most suspicious of mortals could not have dreamed of\\r\\nsuch a cause in so highly respectable a family.  The fires were\\r\\ninvariably put out at night, and guards put on in every room, therefore,\\r\\nno spark could have been so audacious as to have leaped into being and\\r\\non to the floor.  There were, indeed, \"matches\" in the house, but there\\r\\nwere no children, except one old lady, who, having reached her second\\r\\nchildhood, might perhaps have been regarded as a child.  It is true\\r\\nthere was a certain Betty, a housemaid, whose fingers were reported by\\r\\nthe cook to be \"all thumbs,\" and who had an awkward and incurable\\r\\ntendency to spill, and break, and drop, and fall over things, on whom\\r\\nsuspicion fastened very keenly at first; but Betty, who was young and\\r\\nrather pretty, asserted so earnestly that she had been unusually happy\\r\\nthat night in having done nothing whatever of a condemnable nature, and\\r\\nbacked her asseverations with such floods of tears, that she was\\r\\nexonerated, and, as we have said, the cause was reported \"unknown.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not, however, so completely unknown as was at first supposed.\\r\\nThere was a certain grave, retiring, modest individual who knew the\\r\\ngentleman of the house and his doings a little more thoroughly than was\\r\\nagreeable to the said gentleman, and who had become aware, in some\\r\\nunaccountable way, which it is impossible to explain, that he, the said\\r\\ngentleman, had very recently furnished the house in a sumptuous style,\\r\\nand had insured it much beyond its value.  The said individual\\'s\\r\\nknowledge ultimately resulted in the said gentleman being convicted and\\r\\ntransported for arson!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut with all this we have nothing to do.  Whatever the uncertainty that\\r\\nafterwards arose as to the cause of the fire, there could be no\\r\\nuncertainty as to the fire itself at the time.  It blazed and roared so\\r\\nfuriously, that the inside of the house resembled a white-hot furnace.\\r\\nFlames spouted from the windows and chimneys, glaring fiercely on the\\r\\nspectators, who assembled rapidly from all quarters, as if defying them\\r\\nall, and daring the firemen to do their worst.  Sparks enough to have\\r\\nshamed all the Roman candles ever made in or out of Rome were vomited\\r\\nforth continuously, and whirled away with volumes of dense black smoke\\r\\ninto the wintry sky.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s well alight,\" observed a chimney-sweep to a policeman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe policeman made no reply, although it did seem as if it would have\\r\\nbeen quite safe, even for a policeman, to admit that the sweep was\\r\\nthoroughly correct.  It _was_ \"well alight,\" so well, that it seemed\\r\\nabsolutely ridiculous to suppose that the firemen could make any\\r\\nimpression on it at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the firemen did not appear to think the attempt ridiculous.  \"Never\\r\\ngive in\" was, or might have been, their motto.  It was their maxim to\\r\\nattack the enemy with promptitude and vigour, no matter what his\\r\\nstrength might be.  When he crept out like a sneaking burglar from under\\r\\na hearth-stone, or through an over-heated flue, they would \"have at him\"\\r\\nwith the hand-pumps and quench him at once.  When he came forth like a\\r\\ndashing party of skirmishers, to devastate a wood-yard, or light up a\\r\\nmusic-hall with unusual brilliancy, they sent an engine or two against\\r\\nhim without delay, and put him down in an hour or two.  When he attacked\\r\\n\"in force,\" they despatched engine after engine--manuals and steamers--\\r\\nto the front, until he was quelled, and if the prey already seized could\\r\\nnot be wrenched from his grasp, they, at all events, killed him before\\r\\nhe could destroy more.  When he boldly and openly declared war,\\r\\nattacking the great combustible warehouses of Tooley Street, threatening\\r\\na descent on the shipping, and almost setting the Thames on fire, they\\r\\nsent out the whole available army from every quarter of the metropolis\\r\\nwith all their engines of war--manuals, steamers, and floating\\r\\nbatteries, or spouteries, and fought him tooth and nail, till he gave\\r\\nin.  They might be terribly over-matched--as in the case of the great\\r\\nfire when the gallant Braidwood fell--they might lose men, and might\\r\\nhave to fight day and night for weeks, but they would \"never say die,\"\\r\\nuntil the enemy had died and left them, tired and torn, but still tough\\r\\nand triumphant victors on the field of battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the engine from Regent Street came on the ground, two manual\\r\\nengines from Kensington and Notting Hill had arrived, and opened water\\r\\non the foe.  At first their shot fell harmlessly on the roaring furnace;\\r\\nbut by the time the \"steamer\" had got ready for action, some little\\r\\neffect was beginning to be produced.  When this great gun, so to speak,\\r\\nbegan to play, and sent a thick continuous stream through the windows,\\r\\nlike an inexhaustible water mitrailleuse, clouds of white steam mingled\\r\\nwith the black smoke, and varied the aspect of the fire, but did not\\r\\nappear to lessen its fury in any degree.  Just then another manual\\r\\nengine dashed into the square at full gallop, and formed up.  Before it\\r\\nhad well taken a position, another \"steamer,\" with three horses, came\\r\\nswinging round the corner, and fell into the ranks.  The panting steeds\\r\\nwere unharnessed, the bold charioteers leaped down, the suction-pipe was\\r\\ndipped into the water-trough, and the hose attached.  As two engines\\r\\ncannot \"drink\" at the same plug, a canvas trough with an iron frame is\\r\\nput over the plug, having a hole in its bottom, which fits tightly round\\r\\nthe plug.  It quietly fills, and thus two or more engines may do their\\r\\nwork convivially--dip in their suction-pipes, and \"drink\" simultaneously\\r\\nat the same fountain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Down with her!\" shouted the man who held the \"branch,\" or nozzle, at\\r\\nthe end of the hose.\\r\\n\\r\\nA steam whistle gives a shrill, short reply; the engine quivers under\\r\\nthe power of man\\'s greatest servant, and another battery opens on the\\r\\nfoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut London firemen are not content to play at long bowls.  While the\\r\\nartillery goes thus vigorously into action, the helmets of the men are\\r\\nseen gleaming and glancing everywhere amid the smoke, searching for weak\\r\\npoints, turning the enemy\\'s flanks, and taking him in rear.  Hose are\\r\\ndragged through neighbouring houses, trailing their black coils like\\r\\nhorrid water snakes, through places were such things were never meant to\\r\\nbe.  If too short, additional lengths are added, again and again, till\\r\\nthe men who hold the branches gain points of vantage on adjoining roofs\\r\\nor outhouses, until, at last from below, above, in front, and behind,\\r\\ncataracts of water dash into the glowing furnace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fire-escape had been first to reach the ground after the alarm was\\r\\ngiven, this being the instrument nearest to the scene of conflagration.\\r\\nIt happened that night to be in charge of David Clazie, a brother of\\r\\nComrade Bob.  Being a smart young fellow, David, had--with the\\r\\nassistance of two early risers who chanced to be at hand, and the\\r\\npoliceman on the beat--run up his escape, and put it in position before\\r\\nthe fire had gained its full force.  The gentleman of the house had\\r\\nalready got out, and fled in his night garments; but the fire had\\r\\nrendered the staircase impassable, so that the cook, the many-thumbed\\r\\nBetty, and the old lady, who was the gentleman\\'s mother, were imprisoned\\r\\nin the upper floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Clazie did not learn this from the gentleman, however.  That\\r\\namiable character had received such a fright, that he had taken himself\\r\\noff, no one--except the individual aforementioned--knew whither.\\r\\nFortunately, Betty announced the fact of her existence by rushing to a\\r\\nwindow and shrieking.  David ran his escape towards the window, mounted\\r\\nthe ladder, carried the damsel down, bore her, kicking, into a\\r\\nneighbouring house, and left her in fits.  Meanwhile the cook rushed to\\r\\nthe same window, shrieked, and fell back half-suffocated with the smoke\\r\\nwhich just then surrounded her.  A policeman gallantly ran up the\\r\\nescape, jumped into the room, gathered up the cook with great\\r\\ndifficulty--for she was unusually fat and the smoke very suffocating--\\r\\ncarried her down, bore her to the same house where Betty lay, and left\\r\\nher there in violent hysterics.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs neither of them could answer questions, it could not be ascertained\\r\\nwhether there were any more people in the burning house.  David\\r\\ntherefore explored it as far as was possible in the circumstances, and\\r\\nmuch more than was safe for himself, but found no one.  After nearly\\r\\nchoking himself, therefore, he drew aside the escape to prevent its\\r\\nbeing burned.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the engines came up, however, it was again brought into play, to\\r\\nenable the firemen to get up with their \"branches\" to the upper windows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Try that window, Dashwood,\" said the officer of the station to which\\r\\nJoe belonged, pointing to a window on the second floor.  \"There ain\\'t\\r\\nmuch smoke coming out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore he had done speaking, Joe and a comrade had pushed the escape\\r\\ntowards the window in question.  He ascended and leaped into the room,\\r\\nbut could scarcely see for the smoke.  Knowing that the air in a burning\\r\\nhouse is clearer near the floor, he stooped as low as possible, and went\\r\\nround the room guiding himself by the walls.  Coming to a door he seized\\r\\nthe handle and tried to open it, but found it locked, and the handle so\\r\\nhot that he was forced to let go abruptly.  He seized a chair, tried to\\r\\nburst it open with a blow, and shivered the chair to atoms, but did not\\r\\nforce the door.  A powerful effort with his foot also failed.  Rushing\\r\\nto the window he got out on the escape, and shouted:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The axe, lads, look sharp and pass up the hose.  We\\'ll get at it here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA large heavy axe was handed up by one fireman, while another let down a\\r\\nrope, to which the end of the hose was attached and hauled up.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe seized the axe, returned to the door, and, with one blow, dashed it\\r\\nopen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlames leaped upon him, as if they had been eagerly awaiting the\\r\\nopportunity, licked hungrily round his legs, and kissed his whiskers--of\\r\\nwhich, by the way, he was rather proud; and with good reason, for they\\r\\nwere very handsome whiskers.  But Joe cared no more for them at that\\r\\nmoment than he did for his boots.  He was forced to retreat, however, to\\r\\nthe window, where Bob Clazie had already presented his branch and\\r\\ncommenced a telling discharge on the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the way to do it,\" muttered Bob, as he directed the branch and\\r\\nturned aside his head to avoid, as much as possible, the full volume of\\r\\nthe smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let\\'s get a breath o\\' fresh air,\" gasped Joe Dashwood, endeavouring to\\r\\nsqueeze past his comrade through the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment a faint cry was heard.  It appeared to come from an inner\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some one there, Joe,\" said Bob Clazie in a grave tone, but without\\r\\ndiverting his attention for an instant, from the duty in which he was\\r\\nengaged.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe made no reply, but at once leaped back into the room, and, a second\\r\\ntime, felt his way round the walls.  He came on another door.  One blow\\r\\nof the ponderous axe dashed it in, and revealed a bed-room not quite so\\r\\ndensely filled with smoke as the outer room.  Observing a bed looming\\r\\nthrough the smoke, he ran towards it, and struck his head against one of\\r\\nthe posts so violently that he staggered.  Recovering he made a grasp at\\r\\nthe clothes, and felt that there was a human being wrapped tightly up in\\r\\nthem like a bundle.  A female shriek followed.  Joe Dashwood was not the\\r\\nman to stand on ceremony in such circumstances.  He seized the bundle,\\r\\nstraightened it out a little, so as to make it more portable, and\\r\\nthrowing it over his shoulder, made a rush towards the window by which\\r\\nhe had entered.  All this the young fireman did with considerable energy\\r\\nand haste, because the density of the smoke was increasing, and his\\r\\nretreat might be cut off by the flames at any moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Clear the way there!\" he gasped, on reaching the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" replied Bob Clazie, who was still presenting his branch\\r\\nwith untiring energy at the flames.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe passed out, got on the head of the escape, and, holding the bundle\\r\\non his shoulder with one hand, grasped the rounds of the ladder with the\\r\\nother.  He descended amid the cheers of the vast multitude, which had by\\r\\nthis time assembled to witness the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Joe hurried towards the open door of the nearest house, Betty, with\\r\\nthe thumbs, rushed frantically out, screaming, \"Missis! oh! my! she\\'ll\\r\\nbe burnt alive! gracious! help! fire! back room! first floor! oh, my!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be easy, lass,\" cried Joe, catching the flying domestic firmly by the\\r\\narm, and detaining her despite her struggles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me go; missis!  I forgot her!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here she is,\" cried Joe, interrupting, \"all safe.  You come and attend\\r\\nto her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reaction on poor Betty\\'s feelings was so great that she went into\\r\\nfits a second time, and was carried with her mistress into the house,\\r\\nwhere the cook still lay in violent hysterics.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe laid the bundle gently on the bed, and looked quickly at the\\r\\nbystanders.  Observing several cool and collected females among them, he\\r\\npointed to the bundle, which had begun to exhibit symptoms of life, and\\r\\nsaid briefly, \"She\\'s all right, look after her,\" and vanished like a\\r\\nwreath of that smoke into which in another moment he plunged.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not a moment too soon, for he found Bob Clazie, despite his\\r\\nfortitude and resolution, on the point of abandoning the window, where\\r\\nthe smoke had increased to such a degree as to render suffocation\\r\\nimminent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t stand it,\" gasped Bob, scrambling a few paces down the ladder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give us the branch, Bob, I saw where it was in fetchin\\' out the old\\r\\nwoman,\" said Joe in a stifled voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe grasped the copper tube from which the water spouted with such force\\r\\nas to cause it to quiver and recoil like a living thing, so that, being\\r\\ndifficult to hold, it slipped aside and nearly fell.  The misdirected\\r\\nwater-spout went straight at the helmet of a policeman, which it knocked\\r\\noff with the apparent force of a cannon shot; plunged into the bosom of\\r\\na stout collier, whom it washed whiter than he had ever been since the\\r\\ndays of infancy, and scattered the multitude like chaff before the wind.\\r\\nSeeing this, the foreman ordered \"Number 3\" engine, (which supplied the\\r\\nparticular branch in question), to cease pumping.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe recovered the erratic branch in a moment, and dragged it up the\\r\\nescape, Bob, who was now in a breatheable atmosphere, helping to pass up\\r\\nthe hose.  The foreman, who seemed to have acquired the power of being\\r\\nin several places at one and the same moment of time, and whose watchful\\r\\neye was apparently everywhere, ordered Bob\\'s brother David and another\\r\\nman named Ned Crashington, to go up and look after Joe Dashwood.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Joe shouted, \"Down with Number 3;\" by which he meant, \"up with\\r\\nas much water as possible from Number 3, and as fast as you can!\" and\\r\\nsprang into the room from which he had just rescued the old woman.  In\\r\\npassing out with her he had observed a glimmer of flame through the door\\r\\nwhich he had first broken open, and which, he reflected while descending\\r\\nthe escape, was just out of range of Bob Clazie\\'s branch.  It was the\\r\\nthought of this that had induced him to hurry back so promptly; in time,\\r\\nas we have seen, to relieve his comrade.  He now pointed the branch at\\r\\nthe precise spot, and hit that part of the fire right in its heart.  The\\r\\nresult was that clouds of steam mingled with the smoke.  But Joe was\\r\\nhuman after all.  The atmosphere, or, rather, the want of atmosphere,\\r\\nwas too much for him.  He was on the point of dropping the branch, and\\r\\nrushing to the window for his life, when Ned Crashington, feeling his\\r\\nway into the room, tumbled over him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeech was not required in the circumstances.  Ned knew exactly what to\\r\\ndo, and Joe knew that he had been sent to relieve him.  He therefore\\r\\ndelivered the branch to Ned, and at once sprang out on the escape, where\\r\\nhe encountered David Clazie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go in, Davy, he can\\'t stand it long,\" gasped Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No fears of \\'im,\" replied Davy, with a smile, as he prepared to enter\\r\\nthe window; \"Ned can stand hanythink a\\'most.  But, I say, send up some\\r\\nmore \\'ands.  It takes two on us to \\'old _that_ \\'ere branch, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brass helmets of more hands coming up the escape were observed as he\\r\\nspoke, for the foreman saw that this was a point of danger, and, like a\\r\\nwise general, had his reserves up in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Clazie found Ned standing manfully to the branch.  Ned was noted\\r\\nin the Red Brigade as a man who could \"stand a\\'most anything,\" and who\\r\\nappeared to cherish a martyr-like desire to die by roasting or\\r\\nsuffocation.  This was the more surprising that he was not a boastful or\\r\\nexcitable fellow, but a silent, melancholy, and stern man, who, except\\r\\nwhen in action, usually seemed to wish to avoid observation.  Most of\\r\\nhis comrades were puzzled by this compound of character, but some of\\r\\nthem hinted that Crashington\\'s wife could have thrown some light on the\\r\\nsubject.  Be this as it may, whenever the chief or the foreman of the\\r\\nBrigade wanted a man for any desperate work, they invariably turned to\\r\\nNed Crashington.  Not that Ned was one whit more courageous or willing\\r\\nto risk his life than any of the other men, _all_ of whom, it must be\\r\\nremembered, were picked for courage and capacity for their special work;\\r\\nbut he combined the greatest amount of coolness with the utmost possible\\r\\nrecklessness, besides being unusually powerful, so that he could be\\r\\ndepended on for wise as well as desperate action.  Joe Dashwood was\\r\\nthought to be almost equal to Ned--indeed, in personal activity he was\\r\\nsuperior; but there was nothing desperate in Joe\\'s character.  He was\\r\\never ready to dare anything with a sort of jovial alacrity, but he did\\r\\nnot appear, like Ned, to court martyrdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Ned and David subdued the flames above, Joe descended the escape,\\r\\nand being by that time almost exhausted, sat down to rest with several\\r\\ncomrades who had endured the first shock of battle, while fresh men were\\r\\nsent to continue the fight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have a glass, Joe?\" said one of the firemen, coming round with a bottle\\r\\nof brandy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, thank \\'ee,\" said Joe, \"I don\\'t require it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hand it here,\" said a man who stood leaning against the rails beside\\r\\nhim, \"my constitution is good, like the British one, but it\\'s none the\\r\\nworse for a drop o\\' brandy after such tough work.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was probably truth in what the man said.  Desperate work sometimes\\r\\nnecessitates a stimulant; nevertheless, there were men in the Red\\r\\nBrigade who did their desperate work on nothing stronger than water, and\\r\\nJoe was one of these.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn three hours the fire was subdued, and before noon of that day it was\\r\\nextinguished.  The \"report\" of it, as published by the chief of the\\r\\nFire-Brigade next morning, recorded that a house in Ladbroke Square,\\r\\noccupied by Mr Blank, a gentleman whose business was \"private\"--in\\r\\nother words, unknown--had been set on fire by some \"unknown cause,\" that\\r\\nthe whole tenement had been \"burnt out\" and \"the roof off,\" and that the\\r\\ncontents of the building were \"insured in the Phoenix.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the firemen were sent home about daybreak, when the flames first\\r\\nbegan to be mastered.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe was among these.  He found Mary ready with a cup of hot coffee, and\\r\\nthe rosebud, who had just awakened, ready with a kiss.  Joe accepted the\\r\\nsecond, swallowed the first, stretched his huge frame with a sigh of\\r\\nweariness, remarked to Mary that he would turn in, and in five minutes\\r\\nthereafter was snoring profoundly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER THREE.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne pleasant afternoon in spring David Clazie and Ned Crashington sat\\r\\nsmoking together in front of the fire in the lobby of the station,\\r\\nchatting of hair-breadth escapes by flood and fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s cold enough yet to make a fire a very pleasant comrade--w\\'en \\'e\\'s\\r\\ninside the bars,\" observed David.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"H\\'m,\" replied Crashington.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs this was not a satisfactory reply, David said so, and remarked,\\r\\nfurther, that Ned seemed to be in the blues.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wotever can be the matter wi\\' you, Ned,\" said David, looking at his\\r\\ncompanion with a perplexed air; \"you\\'re a young, smart, \\'ealthy fellar,\\r\\nin a business quite to your mind, an\\' with a good-lookin\\' young wife at\\r\\n\\'ome, not to mention a babby.  W\\'y wot more would you \\'ave, Ned?  You\\r\\ndidn\\'t ought for to look blue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pr\\'aps not,\" replied Ned, re-lighting his pipe, and puffing between\\r\\nsentences, \"but a man may be in a business quite to his mind and have a\\r\\ngood-looking wife, and a babby, and health to boot, without bein\\'\\r\\nexactly safe from an attack of the blues now and then, d\\'ye see?  `It\\r\\nain\\'t all gold that glitters.\\'  You\\'ve heard o\\' that proverb, no doubt?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, yes,\" replied Clazie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah.  Then there\\'s another sayin\\' which mayhap you\\'ve heard of too:\\r\\n`every man\\'s got a skeleton in the cupboard.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve heard o\\' that likewise,\" said Clazie, \"but it ain\\'t true;\\r\\nleastways, _I_ have got no skeleton in none o\\' my cupboards, an\\', wot\\'s\\r\\nmore, if I \\'ad, I\\'d pitch him overboard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what if he was too strong for you?\" suggested Ned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, then--I don\\'t know,\" said Clazie, shaking his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore this knotty point could be settled in a satisfactory manner, the\\r\\ncomrades were interrupted by the entrance of a man.  He was a thick-set,\\r\\nill-favoured fellow, with garments of a disreputable appearance, and had\\r\\na slouch that induced honest men to avoid his company.  Nevertheless,\\r\\nNed Crashington gave him a hearty \"good afternoon,\" and shook hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My brother-in-law, Clazie,\" said Ned, turning and introducing him, \"Mr\\r\\nSparks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nClazie was about to say he \"was \\'appy to,\" etcetera, but thought better\\r\\nof it, and merely nodded as he turned to the grate and shook the ashes\\r\\nout of his pipe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll come and have a cup of tea, Phil?  Maggie and I usually have it\\r\\nabout this time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPhil Sparks said he had no objection to tea, and left the station with\\r\\nNed, leaving David Clazie shaking his head with a look of profound\\r\\nwisdom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re a bad lot, you are,\" growled David, after the man was gone, \"a\\r\\nwerry bad lot, indeed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving expressed his opinion to the clock, for there was no one else\\r\\npresent, David thrust both hands into his pockets, and went out to take\\r\\nan observation of the weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Ned Crashington led his brother-in-law to his residence,\\r\\nwhich, like the abodes of the other firemen, was close at hand.\\r\\nEntering it he found his \"skeleton\" waiting for him in the shape of his\\r\\nwife.  She was anything but a skeleton in aspect, being a stout,\\r\\nhandsome woman, with a fine figure, an aquiline nose, and glittering\\r\\nblack eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you\\'ve come at last,\" she said in a sharp, querulous tone, almost\\r\\nbefore her husband had entered the room.  \"Full ten minutes late, and I\\r\\nexpected you sooner than usual to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t know you expected me sooner, Maggie.  Here\\'s Phil come to have\\r\\ntea with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Phil, how are you?\" said Mrs Crashington, greeting her brother\\r\\nwith a smile, and shaking him heartily by the hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, if you\\'d only receive _me_ with a smile like that, _how_ different\\r\\nit might be,\" thought Ned; but he _said_ nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, then, stoopid,\" cried Mrs Crashington, turning quickly round on\\r\\nher husband, as if to counteract the little touch of amiability into\\r\\nwhich she had been betrayed, \"how long are you going to stand there in\\r\\npeople\\'s way staring at the fire?  What are you thinking of?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was thinking of you, Maggie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"H\\'m! thinking no good of me, I dare say,\" replied Maggie, sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did your conscience tell you that?\" asked Ned, with a heightened\\r\\ncolour.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaggie made no reply.  One secret of her bad temper was that she had all\\r\\nher life been allowed to vent it, and now that she was married she felt\\r\\nthe necessity of restraining it very irksome.  Whenever she had gone far\\r\\nenough with Ned, and saw that he was not to be trifled with, she found\\r\\nthat she possessed not only power to control her temper, but the sense,\\r\\nnow and then, to do so!  On the present occasion she at once busied\\r\\nherself in preparing tea, while Ned sat down opposite his\\r\\nbrother-in-law, and, taking Fred, his only child, a handsome boy of\\r\\nabout five years of age, on his knee, began to run his fingers through\\r\\nhis jet black curly hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you get your tasks well to-day, Fred?\" asked Ned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No?\" repeated Ned in surprise; \"why not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I was playin\\' with May Dashwood, father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was that a good reason for neglecting your dooty?\" demanded Ned,\\r\\nshaking his head reproachfully, yet smiling in spite of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Iss, father,\" replied the boy boldly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re wrong, Fred.  No doubt you might have had a worse reason, but\\r\\n_play_ is not a good reason for neglect of dooty.  Only think--what\\r\\nwould be said to me if I was called to a fire, and didn\\'t go because I\\r\\nwanted to play with May Dashwood?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I was sent for,\" pleaded Fred.  \"Mrs Dashwood had a big--oh,\\r\\n_such_ a big washin\\', an\\' sent to say if I might be let go; an\\' mother\\r\\nsaid I might, so I went.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, that alters the case, Fred,\" replied his father, patting the boy\\'s\\r\\nhead.  \"To help a woman in difficulties justifies a\\'most anything.\\r\\nDon\\'t it, Phil?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus appealed to, Phil said that he didn\\'t know, and, what was more, he\\r\\ndidn\\'t care.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now don\\'t sit talkin\\' nonsense, but sit in to tea,\" said Mrs\\r\\nCrashington.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stout fireman\\'s natural amiability had been returning like a flood\\r\\nwhile he conversed with Fred, but this sharp summons rather checked its\\r\\nflow; and when he was told in an exasperating tone to hand the toast,\\r\\nand not look like a stuck pig, it was fairly stopped, and his spirit\\r\\nsank to zero.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you got anything to do yet?\" he asked of Phil Sparks, by way of\\r\\ncheering up a little.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, nothin\\',\" replied Sparks; \"leastways nothin\\' worth mentionin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I _knew_ his last application would fail,\" observed Maggie, in a\\r\\nquietly contemptuous tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis last application had been made through Ned\\'s influence and advice,\\r\\nand that is how she came to _know_ it would fail.\\r\\n\\r\\nNed felt a rising of indignation within him which he found it difficult\\r\\nto choke down, because it was solely for his wife\\'s sake that he had\\r\\nmade any effort at all to give a helping hand to surly Phil Sparks, for\\r\\nwhom he entertained no personal regard.  But Ned managed to keep his\\r\\nmouth shut.  Although a passionate man, he was not ill-tempered, and\\r\\noften suffered a great deal for the sake of peace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"London,\" growled Sparks, in a tone of sulky remonstrance, \"ain\\'t a\\r\\nplace for a man to git on in.  If you\\'ve the luck to have friends who\\r\\ncan help you, an\\' are willin\\', why it\\'s well enough; but if you haven\\'t\\r\\ngot friends, its o\\' no manner o\\' use to try anything, except\\r\\npocket-pickin\\' or house-breakin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Phil,\" said Ned, laughing, as he helped himself to a huge round\\r\\nof buttered toast, \"I \\'ope you han\\'t made up your mind to go in for\\r\\neither of them professions, for they don\\'t pay.  They entail hard work,\\r\\nsmall profits, an\\' great risk--not to mention the dishonesty of \\'em.\\r\\nBut I don\\'t agree with you about London neither.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You never agree with nobody about anythink,\" observed Mrs Crashington,\\r\\nin a low tone, as if the remark were made to the teapot; but Ned heard\\r\\nit, and his temper was sorely tried again, for, while the remark was\\r\\nutterly false as regarded himself, it was particularly true as regarded\\r\\nhis wife.  However, he let it pass, and continued--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see, Phil, London, as you know, is a big place, the population of\\r\\nit being equal to that of all Scotland--so I\\'m told, though it ain\\'t\\r\\neasy to swallow that.  Now it seems to me that where there\\'s so many\\r\\npeople an\\' so much doin\\', it ought to be the very place for smart, stout\\r\\nfellows like you.  If I was you, I\\'d--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but you _ain\\'t_ him,\" interrupted Mrs Crashington, testily, \"so\\r\\nit won\\'t do him much good to tell what you would or wouldn\\'t do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve heard of wives, Maggie, who _sometimes_ tried to be agreeable,\"\\r\\nsaid Ned, gravely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I don\\'t suit you, why did you marry me?\" demanded Maggie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, why indeed?\" said Ned, with a frown.  At this critical point in the\\r\\nconversation, little Fred, who was afraid that a storm was on the point\\r\\nof bursting forth, chanced to overturn his tin mug of tea.  His mother\\r\\nwas one of those obtuse women who regard an accident as a sin, to be\\r\\nvisited by summary punishment.  Her usual method of inflicting\\r\\npunishment was by means of an open-handed slap on the side of the head.\\r\\nOn this occasion she dealt out the measure of justice with such\\r\\ngood-will, that poor little Fred was sent sprawling and howling on the\\r\\nfloor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was too much for Ned, who was a tender-hearted man.  The blood\\r\\nrushed to his face; he sprang up with such violence as to overturn his\\r\\nchair, seized his cap, and, without uttering a word, dashed out of the\\r\\nroom, and went downstairs three steps at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Ned meant to do, or where to go, of course no one could tell, for\\r\\nhe had no definite intentions in his own mind, but his energies were\\r\\nunexpectedly directed for him.  On rushing out at the street door, he\\r\\nfound himself staggering unexpectedly in the arms of Bob Clazie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hullo!  Bob, what\\'s up?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Turn out!\" said Bob, as he wheeled round, and ran to the next fireman\\'s\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\r\\nNed understood him.  He ran smartly to the station, and quickly put on\\r\\nhelmet, belt, and axe.  Already the engine was out, and the horses were\\r\\nbeing harnessed.  In two minutes the men were assembled and accoutred;\\r\\nin three they were in their places--the whip cracked, and away they\\r\\nwent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a good blazing, roaring, soul-stirring fire--a dry-salter\\'s\\r\\nwarehouse, with lots of inflammable materials to give it an intense\\r\\nheart of heat, and fanned by a pretty stiff breeze into ungovernable\\r\\nfury--yet it was as nothing to the fire that raged in Ned\\'s bosom.  If\\r\\nhe had hated his wife, or been indifferent to her, he would in all\\r\\nprobability, like too many husbands, have sought for congenial society\\r\\nelsewhere, and would have been harsh to her when obliged to be at home.\\r\\nBut Ned loved his wife, and would have made any sacrifice, if by so\\r\\ndoing, he could have smoothed her into a more congenial spirit.  When,\\r\\ntherefore, he found that his utmost efforts were of no avail, and that\\r\\nhe was perpetually goaded, and twitted, and tweaked for every little\\r\\ntrifle, his spirit was set alight--as he at last remarked in confidence\\r\\nto David Clazie--and all the fire-engines in Europe, Asia, Africa and\\r\\nAmerica couldn\\'t put it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dry-salter\\'s premises seemed to have been set on fire for poor Ned\\'s\\r\\nspecial benefit that night.  They suited his case exactly.  There was\\r\\nmore than the usual quantity of smoke to suffocate, and fire to roast,\\r\\nhim.  There was considerable danger too, so that the daring men of the\\r\\nbrigade were in request--if we may say that of a brigade in which _all_\\r\\nthe men were daring--and Ned had congenial work given him to do.  The\\r\\nproverbial meeting of Greek with Greek was mere child\\'s play to this\\r\\nmeeting of fire with fire.  The inflamed Ned and the blazing dry-salter\\r\\nmet in mortal conflict, and the result was tremendous!  It made his\\r\\nbrother firemen stand aghast with awful admiration, to observe the way\\r\\nin which Ned dashed up tottering staircases, and along smoke-choked\\r\\npassages, where lambent flames were licking about in search of oxygen to\\r\\nfeed on, and the way in which he hurled down brick walls and hacked\\r\\nthrough wood partitions, and tore up fir-planking and seized branch and\\r\\nhose, and, dragging them into hole-and-corner places, and out upon dizzy\\r\\nbeams, and ridge poles, dashed tons of water in the fire\\'s face, until\\r\\nit hissed again.  It was a fine example of the homoeopathic principle\\r\\nthat \"like cures like;\" for the fire in Ned\\'s bosom did wonders that\\r\\nnight in the way of quenching the fire in the dry-salter\\'s warehouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this had gone on for an hour, and the fire was at its height, Ned,\\r\\nquite exhausted, descended to the street, and, sitting down on the\\r\\npavement, leaned against a rail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you goes on like that, Ned,\" said Bob Clazie, coming up to him,\\r\\n\"you\\'ll bust yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I could,\" said Ned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment, Bob\\'s brother David came towards them with the brandy\\r\\nbottle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have a glass, Ned, you need it,\" said David.\\r\\n\\r\\nNed, although not a teetotaller, was one of the men who did not require\\r\\nspirits, and therefore seldom took more than a sip, but he now seized\\r\\nthe glass, and drained it eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another,\" he cried, holding it up.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid refilled it with a look of some surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nNed drained it a second time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said he, springing up, and tightening his belt, \"I\\'m all right,\\r\\ncome along, Bob!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that he rushed into the burning house, and in a few seconds was\\r\\nseen to take the branch from a fireman on one of the upper floors, and\\r\\ndrag it out on a charred beam that overhung the fire.  The spot on which\\r\\nthey stood was brilliantly illuminated, and it was seen that the fireman\\r\\nremonstrated with Ned, but the latter thrust him away, and stepped out\\r\\non the beam.  He stood there black as ebony, with a glowing background\\r\\nof red walls and fire, and the crowd cheered him for his unwonted\\r\\ncourage; but the cheer was changed abruptly into a cry of alarm as the\\r\\nbeam gave way, and Ned fell head foremost into the burning ruins.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief of the brigade--distinguishable everywhere by his tall\\r\\nfigure--observed the accident, and sprang towards the place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he\\'s not killed by the fall, he\\'s safe from the fire, for it is\\r\\nburnt out there,\" he remarked to David Clazie, who accompanied him.\\r\\nBefore they reached the place, Joe Dashwood and two other men had rushed\\r\\nin.  They found Ned lying on his back in a mixture of charcoal and\\r\\nwater, almost buried in a mass of rubbish which the falling beam had\\r\\ndragged down along with it.  In a few seconds this was removed, and Ned\\r\\nwas carried out and laid on the pavement, with a coat under his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s no cut anywhere that I can see,\" said Joe Dashwood examining\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His fall must have been broke by goin\\' through the lath and plaster o\\'\\r\\nthe ceilin\\' below,\" suggested Bob Clazie.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment, there was a great crash, followed by a loud cry, and a\\r\\ncheer from the multitude, as the roof fell in, sending up a magnificent\\r\\nburst of sparks and flame, in the midst of which Ned Crashington was\\r\\nborne from the field of battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this scene was going on, Mrs Crashington and her brother were\\r\\nstill seated quietly enjoying their tea--at least, enjoying it as much\\r\\nas such characters can be said to enjoy anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Ned had gone out, as before mentioned, Phil remarked:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wouldn\\'t rouse him like that, Mag, if I was you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he\\'s so aggravatin\\',\" pleaded Mrs Crashington.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He ain\\'t half so aggravatin\\' as _you_ are,\" replied Phil, gruffly.  \"I\\r\\ndon\\'t understand your temper at all.  You take all the hard words _I_\\r\\ngive you as meek as a lamb, but if _he_ only offers to open his mouth\\r\\nyou fly at him like a turkey-cock.  However, it\\'s no business o\\' mine,\\r\\nand now,\" he added, rising, \"I must be off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, you won\\'t tell me before you go, what sort of employment you\\'ve\\r\\ngot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Phil, shortly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not, Phil?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I don\\'t want you to know, and I don\\'t want your husband to\\r\\nknow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I won\\'t tell him, Phil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll take good care you can\\'t tell him,\" returned Phil, as he fastened\\r\\na worsted comforter round his hairy throat.  \"It\\'s enough for you to\\r\\nknow that I ain\\'t starvin\\' and that the work pays, though it ain\\'t\\r\\nlikely to make my fortin\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSaying this, Mr Sparks condescended to give his sister a brief nod and\\r\\nleft the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had not been gone much more than a couple of hours, when Mrs\\r\\nCrashington, having put little Fred to sleep, was roused from a reverie\\r\\nby the sound of several footsteps outside, followed by a loud ring at\\r\\nthe bell; she opened the door quickly, and her husband was borne in and\\r\\nlaid on his bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not dead?\" exclaimed the woman in a voice of agony.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, missus, not dead,\" said David Clazie, \"but hardly better, I fear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Maggie looked on the poor bruised form, with garments torn to\\r\\nshreds, and so covered with charcoal, water, lime, and blood, as to be\\r\\nalmost an indistinguishable mass, she could not have persuaded herself\\r\\nthat he was alive, had not a slight heaving of the broad chest told that\\r\\nlife still remained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a \\'orrible sight, that, missus,\" said David Clazie, with a look\\r\\nthat seemed strangely stern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is--oh it is--terrible!\" said Mrs Crashington, scarce able to\\r\\nsuppress a cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, you\\'d better take a good look at it,\" added Clazie, \"for it\\'s your\\r\\nown doing, missus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMaggie looked at him in surprise, but he merely advised her to lend a\\r\\nhand to take the clothes off, as the doctor would be round in a minute;\\r\\nso she silently but actively busied herself in such duties as were\\r\\nnecessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Phil Sparks went about the streets of London attending to the\\r\\nduties of his own particular business.  To judge from appearances, it\\r\\nseemed to be rather an easy occupation, for it consisted mainly in\\r\\nwalking at a leisurely pace through the streets and thoroughfares, with\\r\\nhis hands in his pockets and a pipe in his mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeditation also appeared to be an important branch of this business, for\\r\\nPhil frequently paused in front of a large mansion, or a magnificent\\r\\nshop, and gazed at it so intently, that one might have almost fancied he\\r\\nwas planning the best method of attempting a burglary, although nothing\\r\\nwas farther from Phil\\'s intentions.  Still, his meditations were\\r\\nsometimes so prolonged, that more than one policeman advised him, quite\\r\\nin a friendly way, to \"move on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently, however, Phil turned over no profit, on this business, and\\r\\nwas about to return home supperless to bed, when he suddenly observed\\r\\nsmoke issuing from an upper window.  Rare and lucky chance!  He was the\\r\\nfirst to observe it.  He knew that the first who should convey the alarm\\r\\nof fire to a fire-station would receive a shilling for his exertions.\\r\\nHe dashed off at once, had the firemen brought to the spot in a few\\r\\nminutes, so that the fire was easily and quickly overcome.  Thus honest\\r\\nPhil Sparks earned his supper, and the right to go home and lay his head\\r\\non his pillow, with the happy consciousness of having done a good action\\r\\nto his fellow-men, and performed a duty to the public and himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER FOUR.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is probable that there is not in all the wide world a man--no matter\\r\\nhow depraved, or ill-favoured, or unattractive--who cannot find some\\r\\nsympathetic soul, some one who will be glad to see him and find more or\\r\\nless pleasure in his society.  Coarse in body and mind though Philip\\r\\nSparks was, there dwelt a young woman, in one of the poorest of the poor\\r\\nstreets in the neighbourhood of Thames Street, who loved him, and would\\r\\nhave laid down her life for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo do Martha Reading justice, she had fallen in love with Sparks before\\r\\nintemperance had rendered his countenance repulsive and his conduct\\r\\nbrutal.  When, perceiving the power he had over her, he was mean enough\\r\\nto borrow and squander the slender gains she made by the laborious work\\r\\nof dress-making--compared to which coal-heaving must be mere child\\'s\\r\\nplay--she experienced a change in her feelings towards him, which she\\r\\ncould not easily understand or define.  Her thoughts of him were mingled\\r\\nwith intense regrets and anxieties, and she looked forward to his visits\\r\\nwith alarm.  Yet those thoughts were not the result of dying affection;\\r\\nshe felt quite certain of that, having learned from experience that,\\r\\n\"many waters cannot quench love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, about eight o\\'clock, Phil Sparks, having prosecuted his\\r\\n\"business\" up to that hour without success, tapped at the door of\\r\\nMartha\\'s garret and entered without waiting for permission; indeed, his\\r\\ntapping at all was a rather unwonted piece of politeness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come in, Phil,\" said Martha, rising and shaking hands, after which she\\r\\nresumed her work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You seem busy to-night,\" remarked Sparks, sitting down on a broken\\r\\nchair beside the fireless grate, and taking out his bosom companion, a\\r\\nshort black pipe, which he began to fill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am always busy,\" said Martha, with a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' it don\\'t seem to agree with you, to judge from your looks,\"\\r\\nrejoined the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was true.  The poor girl\\'s pretty face was thin and very pale and\\r\\nhaggard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was up all last night,\" she said, \"and feel tired now, and there\\'s\\r\\nnot much chance of my getting to bed to-night either, because the lady\\r\\nfor whom I am making this must have it by to-morrow afternoon at\\r\\nlatest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Mr Sparks muttered something very like a malediction on ladies in\\r\\ngeneral, and on ladies who \"_must_\" have dresses in particular.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your fire\\'s dead out, Martha,\" he added, poking among the ashes in\\r\\nsearch of a live ember.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Phil, it\\'s out.  I can\\'t afford fire of an evening; besides it\\r\\nain\\'t cold just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can afford matches, I suppose,\" growled Phil; \"ah, here they are.\\r\\nUseful things matches, not only for lightin\\' a feller\\'s pipe with, but\\r\\nalso for--well; so she _must_ have it by to-morrow afternoon, must she?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, so my employer tells me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An\\' she\\'ll not take no denial, won\\'t she?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe not,\" replied Martha, with a faint smile, which, like a gleam\\r\\nof sunshine on a dark landscape, gave indication of the brightness that\\r\\nmight have been if grey clouds of sorrow had not overspread her sky.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the lady\\'s name, Martha?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Middleton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And w\\'ere abouts may she live?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In Conway Street, Knightsbridge.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The number?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Number 6, I believe; but why are you so particular in your inquiries\\r\\nabout her?\" said Martha, looking up for a moment from her work, while\\r\\nthe faint gleam of sunshine again flitted over her face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, you see, Martha,\" replied Phil, gazing through the smoke of his\\r\\npipe with a sinister smile, \"it makes a feller feel koorious to hear the\\r\\npartiklers about a lady wot _must_ have things, an\\' won\\'t take no\\r\\ndenial!  If I was you, now, I\\'d disappoint her, an\\' see how she\\'d take\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wound up his remark, which was made in a bantering tone, with another\\r\\nmalediction, which was earnest enough--savagely so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  Phil,\" cried the girl, in an earnest tone of entreaty; \"don\\'t, oh,\\r\\ndon\\'t swear so.  It is awful to think that God hears you, is near you--\\r\\nat your very elbow--while you thus insult Him to his face.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man made no reply, but smoked with increasing intensity, while he\\r\\nfrowned at the empty fire-place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Martha,\" he said, after a prolonged silence, \"I\\'ve got work at\\r\\nlast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you?\" cried the girl, with a look of interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; it ain\\'t much to boast of, to be sure, but it pays, and, as it\\r\\nties me to nothin\\' an\\' nobody, it suits my taste well.  I\\'m wot you may\\r\\ncall a appendage o\\' the fire-brigade.  I hangs about the streets till I\\r\\nsees a fire, w\\'en, off I goes full split to the nearest fire-station,\\r\\ncalls out the engine, and gits the reward for bein\\' first to give the\\r\\nalarm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed,\" said Martha, whose face, which had kindled up at first with\\r\\npleasure, assumed a somewhat disappointed look; \"I--I fear you won\\'t\\r\\nmake much by that, Phil?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t seem to make much by that,\" retorted Phil, pointing with the\\r\\nbowl of his pipe to the dress which lay in her lap and streamed in a\\r\\nprofusion of rich folds down to the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not much,\" assented Martha, with a sigh.  \"Well, then,\" continued Phil,\\r\\nre-lighting his pipe, and pausing occasionally in his remarks to admire\\r\\nthe bowl, \"that bein\\' so, you and I are much in the same fix, so if we\\r\\nunites our small incomes, of course that\\'ll make \\'em just double the\\r\\nsize.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Phil,\" said Martha, in a lower voice, as she let her hands and the work\\r\\non which they were engaged fall on her lap, \"I think, now, that it will\\r\\nnever be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'ll never be?\" demanded the man rudely, looking at the girl in\\r\\nsurprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our marriage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! are you going to jilt me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heaven forbid,\" said Martha, earnestly.  \"But you and I are not as we\\r\\nonce were, Phil, we differ on many points.  I feel sure that our union\\r\\nwould make us more miserable than we are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, come,\" cried the man, half in jest and half in earnest.  \"This\\r\\nkind of thing will never do.  You mustn\\'t joke about that, old girl,\\r\\nelse I\\'ll have you up for breach of promise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Sparks rose as he spoke, knocked the ashes out of his pipe, put it\\r\\nin his waistcoat pocket, and prepared to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Martha,\" he said, \"I\\'m goin\\' off now to attend to my business, but I\\r\\nhaven\\'t made a rap yet to-day, and its hard working on a empty stomach,\\r\\nso I just looked in to light my pipe, and enquire if you hadn\\'t got a\\r\\nshillin\\' about you, eh!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl looked troubled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, very well,\" cried Sparks, with an offended air, \"if you don\\'t\\r\\n_want_ to accommodate me, never mind, I can get it elsewhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop!\" cried Martha, taking a leathern purse from her pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it _would_ have been rather hard,\" he said, returning and holding\\r\\nout his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There, take it,\" said Martha, \"You shouldn\\'t judge too quickly.  You\\r\\ndon\\'t know _why_ I looked put out.  It is my--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stopped short, and then said hurriedly, \"Don\\'t drink it, Phil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I won\\'t.  I\\'m hungry.  I\\'ll eat it.  Thankee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a coarse laugh he left the room, and poor Martha sat down again to\\r\\nher weary toil, which was not in any degree lightened by the fact that\\r\\nshe had just given away her last shilling.\\r\\n\\r\\nA moment after, the door opened suddenly and Mr Sparks looked in with a\\r\\ngrin, which did not improve the expression of his countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say, I wouldn\\'t finish that dress to-night if I was you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not, Phil?\" asked the girl in surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Cause the lady won\\'t want it to-morrow arternoon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you know that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No matter.  It\\'s by means of a kind of second-sight I\\'ve got, that I\\r\\nfind out a-many things.  All I can say is that I\\'ve got a strong\\r\\nsuspicion--a what d\\'ye call it--a presentiment that Mrs Middleton, of\\r\\nNumber 6, Conway Street, Knightsbridge, won\\'t want her dress to-morrow,\\r\\nso I advise you to go to bed to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout waiting for a reply Mr Sparks shut the door and descended to\\r\\nthe street.  Purchasing and lighting a cheroot at the nearest tobacco\\r\\nshop with part of Martha\\'s last shilling, he thrust his hands into his\\r\\npockets, and sauntering along various small streets and squares, gave\\r\\nhis undivided attention to business.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a man whose wants were rather extensive and urgent, the \"business\"\\r\\ndid not seem a very promising one.  He glanced up at the houses as he\\r\\nsauntered along, appearing almost to expect that some of them would\\r\\nundergo spontaneous combustion for his special accommodation.\\r\\nOccasionally he paused and gazed at a particular house with rapt\\r\\nintensity, as if he hoped the light which flashed from his own eyes\\r\\nwould set it on fire; but the houses being all regular bricks refused to\\r\\nflare up at such a weak insult.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinding his way to Trafalgar Square, Mr Sparks threw away the end of\\r\\nhis cheroot, and, mending his pace, walked smartly along Piccadilly\\r\\nuntil he gained the neighbourhood of Knightsbridge.  Here he purchased\\r\\nanother cheroot, and while lighting it took occasion to ask if there was\\r\\na street thereabouts named Conway Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, there is,\" said a small and exceedingly pert\\r\\ncrossing-sweeper, who chanced to be standing near the open door of the\\r\\nshop, and overheard the question.  \"I\\'ll show you the way for a copper,\\r\\nsir, but silver preferred, if you\\'re so disposed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whereabouts is it?\" asked Mr Sparks of the shopman, regardless of the\\r\\nboy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Round the corner to your right, and after that second turning to your\\r\\nleft.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that\\'s all wrong,\" cried the boy.  \"W\\'y, \\'ow should \\'ee know\\r\\nhanythink about streets?  Never goes nowheres, does nothink but sell\\r\\nsnuff an\\' pigtail, mornin\\', noon, and night.  \\'Ee should have said,\\r\\n_right_ round the corner to your right, and \\'ee should have added `sir,\\'\\r\\nfor that\\'s right w\\'en a gen\\'l\\'m\\'n\\'s spoke to, arter w\\'ich, w\\'en you\\'ve\\r\\nleft this \\'ere street, take second turnin\\' to your left, if you\\'re\\r\\nleft-\\'anded, an\\' then you come hall right.  That\\'s \\'ow \\'ee ought to have\\r\\nsaid it, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the midst of this flow of information, Mr Sparks emerged into the\\r\\nstreet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll show you the way for love, sir, if you ain\\'t got no money,\" said\\r\\nthe boy in a tone of mock sincerity, stepping up and touching his cap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let \\'im alone, Bloater,\" cried another and smaller boy, \"don\\'t you see\\r\\nee\\'s one of the swell mob, an\\' don\\'t want to \\'ave too much attention\\r\\ndrawed to him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No \\'ee ain\\'t, Little Jim, ee\\'s only a gen\\'l\\'m\\'n in disguise,\" replied\\r\\nthe Bloater, sidling up to Mr Sparks, and urgently repeating, \"show you\\r\\nthe way for a copper, sir, _only_ a copper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Sparks, being, as we have said, an irascible man, and particularly\\r\\nout of humour that evening, did not vouchsafe a reply, but, turning\\r\\nsuddenly round, gave the Bloater a savage kick that turned him head over\\r\\nheels into the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bloater, whose proper name was Robert Herring, from which were\\r\\nderived the aliases, Raw Herring and the Bloater, immediately recovered\\r\\nhimself and rushed at Mr Sparks with his broom.  He was a strong,\\r\\nresolute, passionate boy, yet withal good-humoured and placable.  In the\\r\\nfirst burst of indignation he certainly meant to commit a violent\\r\\nassault, but he suddenly changed his mind.  Perhaps the look and\\r\\nattitude of his antagonist had something to do with the change; perhaps\\r\\nthe squeaky voice of Little Jim, shouting \"hooray, Bloater, go in an\\'\\r\\nwin,\" may have aroused his sense of the ludicrous, which was very\\r\\nstrong, and helped to check him.  At all events, instead of bringing his\\r\\nbroom down on the head of Mr Sparks, Bloater performed an impromptu\\r\\nwar-dance round him and flourished his weapon with a rapidity that was\\r\\nonly surpassed by the rapid flow of his language.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now then, Gunpowder, come on; wot do you mean by it--eh?  You\\r\\nlow-minded son of a pepper-castor!  Who let you out o\\' the cruet-stand?\\r\\nWot d\\'ee mean by raisin\\' yer dirty foot ag\\'in a _honest_ man, w\\'ch _you_\\r\\nain\\'t, an\\' never was, an\\' never will be, an\\' never _could_ be, seein\\'\\r\\nthat both your respected parients was \\'anged afore you was born.  Come\\r\\non, I say.  You ain\\'t a coward, air you?  If so, I\\'ll \\'and you over to\\r\\nLittle Jim \\'ere, an\\' stand by to see fair play!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this outburst, Mr Sparks had quietly faced the excited boy,\\r\\nwatching his opportunity to make a dash at him, but the appearance of a\\r\\npoliceman put a sudden termination to the riot by inducing the Bloater\\r\\nand Little Jim to shoulder their brooms and fly.  Mr Sparks, smiling\\r\\ngrimly, (he never smiled otherwise), thrust his hands into his pockets,\\r\\nresumed his cheroot, and held on the even tenor of his way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he had not yet done with the Bloater.  That volatile and revengeful\\r\\nyouth, having run on in advance, ensconced himself behind a projection\\r\\nat the corner of the street close to which Sparks had to pass, and from\\r\\nthat point of vantage suddenly shot into his ear a yell so excruciating\\r\\nthat it caused the man to start and stagger off the pavement; before he\\r\\ncould recover himself, his tormentor had doubled round the corner and\\r\\nvanished.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowling savagely, he continued his walk.  One of the turns to the left,\\r\\nwhich he had to make, led him through a dark and narrow street.  Here,\\r\\nkeeping carefully in the middle of the road for security, he looked\\r\\nsharply on either side, having his hands out of his pockets now, and\\r\\nclenched, for he fully expected another yell.  He was wrong, however, in\\r\\nhis expectations.  The Bloater happened to know of a long ladder, whose\\r\\nnightly place of repose was on the ground in a certain dark passage,\\r\\nwith its end pointing across that street.  Taking up a position beside\\r\\nthis ladder, with Little Jim--who followed him, almost bursting with\\r\\ndelight--he bided his time and kept as quiet as a mouse.  Just in the\\r\\nnick of time the ladder was run out, and Mr Sparks tripping over it,\\r\\nfell violently to the ground.  He sprang up and gave chase, of course,\\r\\nbut he might as well have followed a will-o\\'-the-wisp.  The young\\r\\nscamps, doubling like hares, took refuge in a dark recess under a stair\\r\\nwith which they were well acquainted, and from that position they\\r\\nwatched their enemy.  They heard him go growling past; knew, a moment or\\r\\ntwo later, from the disappointed tone of the growl, that he had found\\r\\nthe opening at the other end of the passage; heard him return, growling,\\r\\nand saw him for a moment in the dim light of the entrance as he left the\\r\\nplace.  Then, swiftly issuing from their retreat, they followed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say, Bloater,\" whispered Little Jim, \"ee\\'s got such an ugly mug that\\r\\nI do b\\'lieve ee\\'s up to some game or other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"P\\'raps \\'ee is,\" returned the Bloater, meditatively; \"we\\'ll let \\'im\\r\\nalone an\\' foller \\'im up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prolonged season of peace that followed, induced Mr Sparks to\\r\\nbelieve that his tormentors had left him, he therefore dismissed them\\r\\nfrom his mind, and gave himself entirely to business.  Arrived at Conway\\r\\nstreet, he found that it was one of those semi-genteel streets in the\\r\\nimmediate neighbourhood of Kensington Gardens, wherein dwell thriving\\r\\ntradespeople who know themselves to be rising in the world, and\\r\\nunfortunate members of the \"upper ten,\" who know that they have come\\r\\ndown in the world, but have not ceased the struggle to keep up\\r\\nappearances.  It was a quiet, unfrequented street, in which the hum of\\r\\nthe surrounding city sounded like the roar of a distant cataract.  Here\\r\\nMr Sparks checked his pace--stopped--and looked about him with evident\\r\\ncaution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ho, ho!\" whispered Little Jim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ve tracked \\'im down,\" replied the Bloater with a chuckle.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Sparks soon found Number 6.  On the door a brass plate revealed\\r\\n\"Mrs Middleton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! she _must_ have it, must she, an\\' _won\\'t_ take no denial,\" muttered\\r\\nthe man between his teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Sparks observed that one of the lower windows was open, which was\\r\\nnot to be wondered at, for the weather was rather warm at the time.  He\\r\\nalso observed that the curtains of the window were made of white\\r\\nflowered muslin, and that they swayed gently in the wind, not far from a\\r\\ncouple of candles which stood on a small table.  There was no one in the\\r\\nroom at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strange,\" muttered Mr Sparks, with a grim smile, \"that people _will_\\r\\nleave lights so near muslin curtains!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMost ordinary people would have thought the candles in question at a\\r\\nsufficiently safe distance from the curtains, but Mr Sparks apparently\\r\\nthought otherwise.  He entertained peculiar views about the danger of\\r\\nfire.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the position which the two boys occupied they could not see the man\\r\\nwhile he was thus engaged in examining and commenting on Number 6,\\r\\nConway Street, but they saw him quite well when he crossed the street,\\r\\n(which had only one side to it, a wall occupying the other), and they\\r\\nsaw him still better in the course of a few seconds when a bright light\\r\\nsuddenly streamed towards him, and illumined his villainous countenance,\\r\\nand they heard as well as saw him, the next instant, when he shouted\\r\\n\"_fire--fire_!\" and rushed frantically away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hallo!\" exclaimed the Bloater, and dashed off at full speed.  Little\\r\\nJim echoed the sentiment and followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert, alias Raw Herring, was a sharp-witted lad.  He understood the\\r\\ncase, (partly at least), in a moment, and proceeded to appropriate\\r\\naction.  Being intimately acquainted with that part of London, he took a\\r\\nshort cut, overshot Mr Sparks, and was first to give the alarm at the\\r\\nfire-station.  When, therefore, Mr Sparks ran in, panting and shouting\\r\\n\"fire!\" great was his surprise to find the men already roused, and the\\r\\nhorses being attached to the engine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where away?\" inquired one of the firemen, supposing that Sparks,\\r\\nperhaps, brought information of another fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Number 6, Conway Street,\" he gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, we\\'ve got the noos already.  The boys brought it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bloater, with a mouth extending from ear to ear and all his teeth\\r\\ndisplayed, uttered the single word \"sold!\" as Mr Sparks turned his eyes\\r\\non him.  One glance was enough.  The man became very pale, and suddenly\\r\\nleft the station amid a shout of laughter from the firemen, as they\\r\\nleaped on the engine and drove away, followed by the two boys whose\\r\\nspirits were already excited to the highest pitch of ecstasy by a fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was early morning before the fire was subdued, and Number 6 left the\\r\\nblackened skeleton of a house.  Long before that, the Bloater and Little\\r\\nJim had sought repose in the cart-shed of a neighbouring stable.  Long\\r\\nbefore that Mr Philip Sparks had retired to rest, growling anathemas on\\r\\nthe heads of boys in general, and crossing-sweepers in particular; and\\r\\nnot _very_ long before that poor Martha Reading had put in the last\\r\\nstitch of her work, and fallen into a profound sleep in her chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Sparks turned out to be a true prophet.  Mrs Middleton did _not_\\r\\ninsist on having her dress home that afternoon, and when Martha, true to\\r\\nher promise, conveyed it to Number 6, Conway Street, she found no one\\r\\nthere to receive it except a few drenched men of the Red Brigade, and\\r\\nthe police.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER FIVE.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Philip Sparks, though not naturally fond of society, was,\\r\\nnevertheless, obliged to mingle occasionally with that unpleasant body,\\r\\nfor the purpose of recruiting his finances.  He would rather have\\r\\nremained at home and enjoyed his pipe and beer in solitude, but that was\\r\\nnot possible in the circumstances.  Owing, no doubt, to the selfishness\\r\\nof the age in which he lived, people would _not_ go and pour money into\\r\\nhis pockets, entreat him to accept of the same, and then retire without\\r\\ngiving him any farther trouble.  On the contrary, even when he went out\\r\\nand took a great deal of trouble to obtain money--much more trouble than\\r\\nhe would have had to take, had he been an honest working man--people\\r\\nrefused to give it to him, but freely gave him a good deal of gratuitous\\r\\nadvice instead, and sometimes threatened the donation of other favours\\r\\nwhich, in many instances, are said to be more numerous than ha\\'pence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings in general being in this untoward condition, Mr Sparks went out\\r\\none morning and entered into society.  Society did not regard him with a\\r\\nfavourable eye, but Sparks was not thin-skinned; he persevered, being\\r\\ndetermined, come what might, to seek his fortune.  Poor fellow, like\\r\\nmany a man in this world who deems himself a most unlucky fellow, he had\\r\\nyet to learn the lesson that fortunes must be _wrought_ for, not\\r\\n_sought_ for, if they are to be found.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinding society gruffer than usual that morning, and not happening to\\r\\nmeet with his or anybody else\\'s fortune in any of the streets, through\\r\\nwhich he passed, he resolved to visit Martha Reading\\'s abode; did so,\\r\\nand found her \"not at home.\"  With despairing disgust he then went to\\r\\nvisit his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Crashington was obviously at home, for she opened the door to him,\\r\\nand held up her finger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hallo, Mag!\" exclaimed Sparks, a little surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hush!\" said Mrs Crashington, admitting him, \"speak low.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus admonished, Mr Sparks asked in a hoarse whisper, \"what was up?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ned\\'s had a bad fall, Phil,\" whispered Mrs Crashington, in a tremulous\\r\\ntone that was so unlike her usual voice as to make Sparks look at her in\\r\\nsurprise not unmingled with anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t mean to say, Mag, that he\\'s a-goin\\' to--to--knock under?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not, Phil, but--the doctor--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the poor woman broke down altogether, and sobbed quietly as she led\\r\\nher brother through the house, and into the little bed-room where the\\r\\ninjured fireman lay.\\r\\n\\r\\nNed\\'s bruised, burned, and lacerated frame was concealed under a\\r\\npatchwork coverlet.  Only his face was visible, but that, although the\\r\\nleast injured part of his body, was so deadly pale that even Mr Sparks\\r\\nwas solemnised by the supposition that he was in the presence of Death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Ned, Ned!\" exclaimed Maggie, unable to repress her grief, \"can\\r\\nyou--can you ever forgive me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laid her hand on the fireman\\'s broad breast, and passionately kissed\\r\\nhis brow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe opened his eyes, and whispered with difficulty, \"Forgive you, Maggie?\\r\\nGod for ever bless you.\"  He could say no more, owing to excessive\\r\\nweakness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, missus, you mustn\\'t disturb him,\" said David Clazie, emerging\\r\\nfrom behind the curtains at the foot of the bed.  \"The doctor\\'s orders\\r\\nwas strict--to keep \\'im quiet.  You\\'d better go into the other room, an\\'\\r\\nyour brother likewise.  Pr\\'aps you might send \\'im to tell Joe Dashwood\\r\\nto be ready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Clazie, who was more a man of action than of words, quietly, but\\r\\nfirmly, ejected the brother and sister from the little room while he was\\r\\nspeaking, and, having shut the door, sat down at his post again as a\\r\\nguard over his sick comrade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seems to me it\\'s all up with \\'im,\" observed Sparks, as he stood gazing\\r\\nuneasily into the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mrs Crashington replied only by sobbing, he continued, after a few\\r\\nminutes--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does the doctor say it\\'s all up, Mag?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, oh no,\" replied the poor woman, \"he don\\'t quite say so; but I can\\'t\\r\\ngit no comfort from that.  Ned has lost _such_ a quantity of blood, it\\r\\nseems impossible for him to git round.  They\\'re goin\\' to try a operation\\r\\non \\'im to-day, but I can\\'t understand it, an\\' don\\'t believe in it.  They\\r\\ntalk of puttin\\' noo blood into \\'im!  An\\' that reminds me that the doctor\\r\\nis to be here at twelve.  Do run round, Phil, to the Dashwoods, and tell\\r\\nJoe to be here in good time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s Joe wanted for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind, but go and tell him that.  I can\\'t talk just now,\" she\\r\\nsaid, pushing her brother out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nTapping at Joe Dashwood\\'s door, Phil received from a strong, deep voice\\r\\npermission to \"come in.\"  He entered, and found a very different state\\r\\nof things from that which he had just left.  A bright room, and bright,\\r\\nhappy faces.  The windows were bright, which made the light appear\\r\\nbrighter than usual; the grate was bright; the furniture was bright; the\\r\\nface of the clock, whose interior seemed about to explode on every\\r\\noccasion of striking the hour, was bright--almost to smiling; and the\\r\\npot-lids, dish-covers, etcetera, were bright--so bright as to be\\r\\nabsolutely brilliant.  Joe Dashwood and his little wife were conversing\\r\\nnear the window, but, although their faces were unquestionably bright by\\r\\nreason of contentment, coupled with a free use of soap and the\\r\\njack-towel, there was, nevertheless, a shade of sadness in their looks\\r\\nand tones.  Nothing of the sort, however, appeared on the countenances\\r\\nof the Rosebud and young Fred Crashington.  These gushing little\\r\\noffshoots of the Red Brigade were too young to realise the danger of\\r\\nNed\\'s condition, but they were quite old enough to create an imaginary\\r\\nfire in the cupboard, which they were wildly endeavouring to extinguish\\r\\nwith a poker for a \"branch\" and a bucket for a fire-engine, when Mr\\r\\nSparks entered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! kik, Feddy, kik; put it out kik, or it\\'ll bu\\'n down all \\'e house,\"\\r\\ncried little May, eagerly, as she tossed back a cataract of golden curls\\r\\nfrom her flushed countenance, and worked away at the handle of the\\r\\nbucket with all her might.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right!\" shouted Fred, who had been sent to play with the Rosebud\\r\\nthat he might be out of the way.  \"Down with Number 1; that\\'s your sort;\\r\\nkeep \\'er goin\\'; hooray!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe brought the poker down with an awful whack on the cupboard at this\\r\\npoint, causing the crockery to rattle again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hallo! youngster, mind what you\\'re about,\" cried Joe, \"else there will\\r\\nbe more damage caused by the engine than the fire--not an uncommon\\r\\nthing, either, in our practice!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at this point that he replied to Mr Sparks\\'s knock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come in, Mr Sparks, you\\'ve heard of your poor brother-in-law\\'s\\r\\naccident, I suppose?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I\\'ve just comed from his house with a message.  You\\'re wanted to\\r\\nbe there in good time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, I\\'ll be up to time,\" said Joe, putting on his coat and cap,\\r\\nand smiling to his wife, as he added, \"It\\'s a queer sort o\\' thing to do.\\r\\nWe\\'ll be blood-relations, Ned and I, after this.  Look after these\\r\\nyoungsters, Molly, else they\\'ll knock your crockery to bits.  Good-day.\\r\\nMr Sparks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-day,\" replied Sparks, as Joe went out.  Then, turning to Mrs\\r\\nDashwood, \"What sort of operation is it they\\'re goin\\' to perform on\\r\\nNed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you not hear?  It\\'s a very curious one.  Ned has lost so much blood\\r\\nfrom a deep cut in his leg that the doctors say he can\\'t recover, no\\r\\nmatter how strong his constitution is, unless he gits some blood put\\r\\ninto him, so they\\'re goin\\' to put some o\\' my Joe\\'s blood into him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!\" exclaimed Sparks, \"take blood out o\\' your husband and put it hot\\r\\nand livin\\' into Ned?  No, no, I\\'ve got a pretty big swallow, but I can\\'t\\r\\ngit _that_ down.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you can\\'t swallow it you\\'ll have to bolt it, then, for it\\'s a fact,\"\\r\\nreturned Mary, with a laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how do they mean to go about it?\" asked Sparks, with an unbelieving\\r\\nexpression of countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I ain\\'t quite sure about that,\" replied Mary; \"they say that the\\r\\ndoctor cuts a hole in a vein of the arms of both men, and puts a pipe,\\r\\nor something of that sort, into the two veins, and so lets the blood run\\r\\nfrom the one man into the other.  I don\\'t half believe it myself, to say\\r\\ntruth; but it\\'s quite true that they\\'re goin\\' to try it on Ned.  The\\r\\ndoctor says it has bin tried before with great success, and that the\\r\\nmain thing is to get a stout, healthy young man to take the blood from.\\r\\nThey thought, at first, to get a healthy youth from the country, but my\\r\\nJoe begged so hard to let him supply his friend and comrade, with what\\r\\nthey wanted, that they agreed, and now he\\'s off to have it done.  Ain\\'t\\r\\nit funny?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Funny!\" exclaimed Sparks, \"well, it is, just.  But I\\'m not such a fool\\r\\nas to believe that they can pump the blood out o\\' one man into another\\r\\nin that fashion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope they can for poor Ned\\'s sake,\" said Mary, in a sad tone, as she\\r\\nstirred a large pot which stood simmering on the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a short silence after that, for Mary was thinking of the\\r\\nstrange operation that was probably going on at that moment, and Phil\\r\\nSparks was debating with himself as to the propriety of attempting to\\r\\ninduce Mrs Dashwood to lend him a shilling or two.  He could not easily\\r\\nmake up his mind, however; not because he was ashamed to ask it, but,\\r\\nbecause he was afraid of receiving a rebuke from the pretty little\\r\\nwoman.  He knew that she and Martha Reading were intimate friends, and\\r\\nhe had a suspicion that Mrs Dashwood was aware of Martha\\'s fondness for\\r\\nhim, and that she bore him no good will in consequence.  Besides,\\r\\nalthough one of the sweetest tempered women in London, Mary was one\\r\\nwhose indignation could be roused, and whose clear blue eye had\\r\\nsomething overawing in it, especially to scoundrels.  He therefore sat\\r\\nthere more than an hour, conversing on various subjects, while Mary\\r\\nbusied herself in household matters; which she occasionally left off in\\r\\norder to assist in extinguishing the fire in the cupboard!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last Sparks resolved to make the attempt, and thought he would begin\\r\\nby trying to propitiate Mary by commenting on her child.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s a pretty little girl of yours, missis,\" he remarked in a casual\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That she is,\" cried Mary, catching up the child and kissing her rosy\\r\\nface all over; \"and she\\'s better than pretty--she\\'s good, good as gold.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh \\'top, ma.  Let May down, kik!  Fire not out yit!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s right, never give in, May.  Wot a jolly fireman you\\'d make!\"\\r\\ncried Fred, still directing all his energies to the cupboard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s a queer sort o\\' helmet the boy\\'s got on,\" said Sparks, alluding\\r\\nto a huge leathern headpiece, of a curious old-fashioned form, which was\\r\\nrolling about on the boy\\'s head, being much too large for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was bought for him by my Joe, in an old curiosity shop,\" said Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha!\" replied Sparks.  \"Well, Missis Dashwood, I\\'ll have to be goin\\',\\r\\nthough I haven\\'t got no business to attend to--still, a man must keep\\r\\nmovin\\' about, you know, specially w\\'en he\\'s had no breakfast, an\\' han\\'t\\r\\ngot nothin\\' to buy one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s a sad condition,\" said Mary, pursing her lips, for she knew the\\r\\nman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is, missis.  You couldn\\'t lend me half-a-crown, could you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I couldn\\'t,\" replied the little woman with decision, while her\\r\\ncheeks reddened; \"moreover, I wouldn\\'t if I could.  You ought to be\\r\\nashamed of yourself, Mr Sparks; it\\'s a disgrace for a man of your\\r\\nstrength and years to be goin\\' about borrowing as you\\'re in the habit of\\r\\ndoin\\'; and you have got the impudence, too, to be running after poor\\r\\nMartha Reading, but you shall never get her if I can prevent it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Sparks was much nettled by the first part of Mrs Dashwood\\'s speech.\\r\\nThe last part put him in a towering passion.  He started up, but had\\r\\nthe wisdom to restrain himself to some extent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" he said, between his teeth, \"you _can\\'t_ prevent it, missis.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps not, but I shall try.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment, Master Fred Crashington chanced to stumble in his\\r\\nenergetic attempts to extinguish the fire in the cupboard, which the\\r\\nRosebud assured him, in excited tones, was \"not out yit; gittin\\' wus an\\'\\r\\nwus!\"  In falling, the old-fashioned helmet flew off, and the comb of it\\r\\nhit Mr Sparks a severe blow on the shin-bone.  In the heat of the\\r\\nmoment he dealt Fred a violent slap on the cheek, which sent him\\r\\ntumbling and howling on the floor.  At that moment the door opened and\\r\\nJoe Dashwood entered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had heard the noise before entering, and now stood with a stern frown\\r\\non his face as he gazed at his wife and her visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did _you_ do that?\" he demanded of Sparks, pointing to the little boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He did, Joe,\" said Mary; \"but--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe waited for no more.  He seized Mr Sparks by the nape of the neck\\r\\nwith a grip that almost choked him--strong though he was--and thrust him\\r\\nout of the room, down the stairs, and out into the street, where he gave\\r\\nhim a final kick, and shut the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, dear Joe!\" exclaimed Mary, on his return, \"you shouldn\\'t have been\\r\\nso violent to \\'im.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"W\\'y not, Molly?  Surely you would not have me stand by and look on,\\r\\nwhile he insulted you and knocked down the boy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, but it would have been a better rebuke if you had ordered him off\\r\\nquietly.  No good ever comes of violence, Joe, and he\\'s such a spiteful,\\r\\nvindictive man that he will never forgive you--perhaps he\\'ll do you a\\r\\nmischief if he ever gets the chance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope he will never get the chance,\" replied Joe.  \"I hope not, but I\\r\\nfear him,\" said Mary.  \"But tell me, Joe, how has the operation\\r\\nsucceeded?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"First-rate, Molly.  Ned and I are blood-relations now!  I don\\'t know\\r\\nhow much they took out o\\' me, but it don\\'t signify, for I am none the\\r\\nworse, an\\' poor Ned seems much the better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Joe entered into a minute detail of all that had been done--how a\\r\\npuncture had been made in one of the veins of his arm, and another in\\r\\none of the veins of Ned\\'s arm; and how the end of a small tube with a\\r\\nbulb in the middle of it had been inserted into _his_ puncture, and the\\r\\nother end into _Ned\\'s_ puncture, and the blood pumped, as it were, from\\r\\nthe full-blooded man into the injured man until it was supposed that he\\r\\nhad had enough of it; and how Ned had already shown signs of revival\\r\\nwhile he, (Joe), didn\\'t feel the loss at all, as was made abundantly\\r\\nevident by the energetic manner in which he had kicked Mr Sparks out of\\r\\nhis house after the operation was over.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo all this Mary listened with wide open eyes, and Fred Crashington\\r\\nlistened with wider open eyes; and little Rosebud listened with eyes and\\r\\nmouth equally open--not that she understood anything of it, but because\\r\\nthe others were in that condition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, May, my pet,\" cried the fireman, catching up his little one and\\r\\ntossing her in the air, \"Ned, that is so fond of you, is a\\r\\nblood-relation, so you may call him `uncle\\' next time he comes--uncle\\r\\nNed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unkil Ned,\" lisped the Rosebud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And me cousin,\" chimed in Fred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Iss--cuzn,\" responded May.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just so,\" cried Joe, seizing Fred round the waist and tossing him on\\r\\nhis right shoulder--Rosebud being already on his left--\"come, I\\'ll carry\\r\\nyou down the fire-escape now; hurrah! down we go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long Joe would have gone on playing with the children we cannot say,\\r\\nfor he was interrupted by the entrance of Bob and David Clazie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come along, Joe,\" said the latter, \"it\\'s your turn to go along with us\\r\\nto drill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s \\'ard work to \\'ave to go playin\\' at fires doorin\\' the day, an\\'\\r\\nputtin\\' of \\'em out doorin\\' the night, Joe; ain\\'t it?\" said Bob Clazie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So \\'tis Bob, but it must be done, you know.  Duty first, pleasure\\r\\nafterwards,\" replied Joe, with a laugh.  \"Besides, the green hands could\\r\\nnever learn how to do it if they hadn\\'t some of the old uns to show \\'em\\r\\nthe way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hall right,\" replied Bob; \"come along.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey left the room with a hearty \"good-day\" to Mrs Dashwood, and a nod\\r\\nto the children.\\r\\n\\r\\nPutting on the round sailor\\'s caps which replaced the helmets when they\\r\\nwere not on actual service, the three firemen took their way towards the\\r\\ncity, and finally reached a large piece of open ground, where a number\\r\\nof very old houses had been partly pulled down, to be soon replaced by\\r\\nnew ones.  The Fire-Brigade had obtained permission to perform their\\r\\ndrill there until the ground should be required.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a curious waste place in the heart of the great city, with\\r\\nrubbish cumbering the ground in front of the half demolished houses.\\r\\nHere several ungainly fire-escapes leaned against the ruined walls, and\\r\\nthrust their heads through broken windows, or stood on the ground,\\r\\nrampant, as if eager to have their heads crammed into smoke and flames.\\r\\nHere also were several manual engines, with their appropriate gearing\\r\\nand hose, and near to these were grouped a band of as fine, fresh,\\r\\nmuscular young fellows as one could wish to see.  These were the new\\r\\nhands of the brigade--the young men, recently engaged, who were\\r\\nundergoing drill.  Each was a picked, and, to some extent, a proved man.\\r\\nThe lightest and least powerful among these men was a sturdy,\\r\\ncourageous fellow.  He, like the others, had been tried at an old\\r\\nfire-escape which stood in a corner of the yard, and which was unusually\\r\\nlarge and cumbrous.  If he had failed to \"work\" various portions of that\\r\\nescape single-handed, without assistance, he would have been pronounced\\r\\nphysically unfit for the service.  Courage and strength alone would not\\r\\nhave been sufficient.  Weight, to a certain extent, was essential.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong these youths were several of the older hands, and one or two\\r\\nofficers of the brigade, the latter being distinguished by brass\\r\\nornaments or \"brasses\" on their shoulders.  They were there to\\r\\nsuperintend and direct.  In the midst of them stood their chief,\\r\\nexplaining the minutiae of the work they had to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen our three firemen reached the drill-ground the chief was showing\\r\\nhis recruits how to coil several lengths of the hose, so as to avoid a\\r\\ntwist or \"kink,\" which might endanger its bursting when the water was\\r\\nturned suddenly on by the powerful \"steamers.\"  He then pointed to the\\r\\ntall empty buildings beside him and ordered his recruits to go into the\\r\\nthird floor of the premises, drag up the hose, and bring the branch to\\r\\nbear on the back rooms, in which fire was supposed to be raging.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look alive, now,\" he said, \"see how quickly you\\'ll manage it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly the active youths sprang to their work.  Some got the hose out\\r\\nof the box of an engine and uncoiled it length by length towards the\\r\\nhouse, others screwed the lengths together at the same time that the\\r\\nwater-trough was being set up and the suction-pipe attached.  Meanwhile,\\r\\nsome had run up into the building, and from an upper window let down a\\r\\nrope so as to be ready to drag up the hose when it was made long enough\\r\\nto reach them.  Thus they practised during the forenoon the mimic\\r\\nwarfare with the flames which they should have to carry into actual\\r\\noperation at night.  In another part of the yard a foreman was\\r\\ninstructing some recruits in the use of the fire-escape.  Under a\\r\\nneighbouring archway stood a small group of idlers looking on at these\\r\\nstirring operations, one of these was Philip Sparks, another was the\\r\\nBloater.  The interests of the first had taken him there, the second had\\r\\nbeen led to the scene by his affections.  Sparks did not observe the\\r\\nBloater, but the Bloater being unusually sharp, had observed Sparks,\\r\\nand, with a look of surprise and glee at the unexpected sight, set\\r\\nhimself to watch and listen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s him,\" growled Sparks in a low whisper, pointing to Joe Dashwood\\r\\nas he entered the yard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was said to a dark-skinned, ill-looking, powerful man who stood at\\r\\nhis elbow.  The man nodded in reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take a good look at him, Jeff; you\\'ll know him again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJeff nodded and guessed that he would.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, West-End; Friday, at 12 p.m. Number 5, close to the\\r\\nfire-station.  You won\\'t forget?\" whispered Sparks, as he and his\\r\\nill-looking friend slunk away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say,\" observed the Bloater, poking Little Jim in the ribs, and\\r\\nlooking down at him with one eye shut, \"you and I shall form an\\r\\nengagement for Friday night--shan\\'t we.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Jim opened his eyes very wide, pressed his mouth very tight, and\\r\\nnodded his head violently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well then,\" continued the Bloater, repeating Sparks\\'s words in a deep\\r\\nstage whisper, \"West-End; Friday, at 12 p.m. Number 5, close to the\\r\\nfire-station.  You won\\'t forget?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Jim again nodded his head, and uttered a little shriek of\\r\\ndelight.  This attracted the notice of a policeman, who hinted, as\\r\\ndelicately as possible, that the boys had better \"move on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey took the hint, and retired precipitately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER SIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! but it _was_ an interesting occupation to watch the expression of\\r\\nLittle Jim\\'s countenance, as the Bloater watched it, while the two boys\\r\\nwere on their way to the \"West-End\" that evening, bent on doing duty as\\r\\namateur watchmen on \"Number 5,\" close to the fire-station.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your face ain\\'t cherubic,\" observed the Bloater, looking down at his\\r\\nlittle friend.  \"If anythink, I should say it partakes of the diabolic;\\r\\nso you\\'ve got no occasion to make it wus than it is by twistin\\' it about\\r\\nlike that.  Wotever do you do it for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Jim replied by a sound which can only be represented by the\\r\\nletters \"sk,\" pronounced in the summit of the nose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That ain\\'t no answer,\" said the Bloater, with a knowing smile, the\\r\\nknowingness of which consisted chiefly in the corners of the mouth being\\r\\nturned down instead of up.  This peculiarity, be it carefully observed,\\r\\nwas natural to the Bloater, who scorned every species of affectation.\\r\\nMany of his young friends and admirers were wont to imitate this smile.\\r\\nIf they could have seen the inconceivably idiotic expressions of their\\r\\ncountenances when they tried it, they would never have made a second\\r\\neffort!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wot a jolly lark!\" said Little Jim, prefacing the remark with another\\r\\n\"sk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha!\" replied the Bloater, with a frown that implied the pressure of\\r\\nweighty matters on his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few minutes\\' silence, during which the cherubic face of Little\\r\\nJim underwent various contortions, the Bloater said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I ain\\'t mistaken, Jim, you and I are sound of wind and limb?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJim looked up in surprise, and nodded assent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Besides which,\" continued the Bloater, \"we\\'re rayther fleet than\\r\\notherwise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain Jim nodded and grinned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No Bobby as ever stuck \\'is hignorant hinsolent \\'ead into a \\'elmet ever\\r\\ncould catch us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sk!\" ejaculated Jim, expanding from ear to ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" continued the Bloater, becoming more grave and\\r\\nconfidential, \"it\\'s my opinion, Jim, that you and I shall \\'ave a run for\\r\\nit to-night.  It\\'s quite plain that our hamiable friend who seems so\\r\\nfond o\\' fire-raisin\\' is goin\\' to pay \\'is respects to Number 5.  \\'Avin\\'\\r\\ngot it well alight it is just within the bounds o\\' the possible--not to\\r\\nsay prob\\'ble--that \\'e\\'ll give \\'em leg-bail--make tracks, as the Yankees\\r\\nsay--cut and run for it.  Well, in course it would never do to let \\'im\\r\\ngo off alone, or with only a \\'eavy stoopid, conceited slow-coach of a\\r\\nBobby at \\'is tail.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" responded Little Jim; \"that would never do.  Quite out of the\\r\\nquestion.  \\'Ighly himproper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Therefore,\" said the Bloater, with emphasis, \"you and I shall \\'ave to\\r\\nkeep our heyes on \\'im, shan\\'t we?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put this concluding question with a wink of such astounding\\r\\nsignificance, that Little Jim could only reply with another \"sk!\" as he\\r\\nstopped for a few moments to hug himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the fire-station \"close to Number 5,\" the firemen lounged about that\\r\\nevening with the air of men who, although they chanced to be idle at the\\r\\nmoment, were nevertheless on the alert and ready for action at a\\r\\nmoment\\'s notice.  Their large folding-doors stood open with an air of\\r\\noff-hand hospitality.  A couple of engines stood within, glittering from\\r\\nexcessive polish and cleanliness.  Coils of hose and buckets, etcetera,\\r\\nwere seen here and there in readiness, while in an interior room a\\r\\nglimpse might be had of gleaming brass helmets, which hung in a row on\\r\\nthe wall, each with an axe pendant below it; and, opposite to these, a\\r\\nrow of dry boots arranged on pegs with their soles to the ceiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two boys lingered about the station admiring all this, and\\r\\ncommenting in their own peculiar fashion on men and things, sometimes\\r\\napprovingly, often critically, and now and then disparagingly.  They\\r\\nsometimes ventured to address a remark or two to any of the men who\\r\\nchanced to look at them with a sufficiently good-humoured expression,\\r\\nand even went the length of asking Bob Clazie if, in the event of the\\r\\nThames going on fire, \"\\'e thought \\'e could manage to put it hout!\" to\\r\\nwhich Bob replied that he thought he could if \"cheek\" were a\\r\\nfire-extinguisher, and he only had a brigade of boys equal to the\\r\\nBloater to help him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the night advanced the firemen devoted themselves to pipes, draughts,\\r\\nand miscellaneous conversation in their back room, in which they were\\r\\noccasionally interrupted by the tingle of the telegraphic bell, to\\r\\ninform them that there was a chimney on fire in Holborn, to which they\\r\\nneed pay no attention, even though \"called\" by an excited informer,\\r\\nbecause it was already being attended to, and didn\\'t merit farther\\r\\nnotice; or to let them know that there was a fire raging in Whitechapel,\\r\\nwhich, although being most energetically looked after by the men of the\\r\\nbrigade in its immediate neighbourhood, would be the better of aid,\\r\\nnevertheless, from _one_ man from that station.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn such distant duty, Bob Clazie and his brother David were successively\\r\\nsent out in different directions during the first part of the night; but\\r\\nthey returned in the course of an hour or so--Bob considerably dirtied\\r\\nand moistened in consequence of having had to go vigorously into action\\r\\nat the tail end of a fire, while David returned as he went, having found\\r\\nthat _his_ fire had been effectually got under before his arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly once during the night did a regular \"call\" reach the station.  It\\r\\nwas about eleven o\\'clock.  Our youthful watchmen, feeling that the\\r\\nappointed hour was drawing nigh, had retired to the shade of a\\r\\nneighbouring court to avoid observation, when a man came tearing round\\r\\nthe corner, dashed into the fire-station, tumbled over a bucket into the\\r\\nmidst of the men, and yelled, \"Fire!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn three minutes the engine was out, the horses were attached, the men\\r\\nin their places, and away they went.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! let\\'s follow,\" cried Little Jim, enthusiastically, while his eyes\\r\\nglittered as if they, too, were on fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more sedate Bloater laid his hand heavily on his little friend\\'s\\r\\nshoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Jim, no.  Business fust, pleasure arterwards.  We\\'ve got business\\r\\non hand to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Jim felt the force of the observation, and made what we may call\\r\\na mighty effort--considering that he was such a mite of a thing--to\\r\\nrestrain himself.  His heroism was rewarded, for, in less than half an\\r\\nhour, the engine came rattling back again, its services not having been\\r\\nrequired!  The fire had occurred close to the fire-escape, of which one\\r\\nof the men of that station had the charge that night.  He had run to the\\r\\nfire with his escape at the first alarm, and had brought to bear on it\\r\\nthe little hand fire-engine, with which all the escapes are now\\r\\nprovided.  At that early stage in the fire, its little stream was more\\r\\neffectual than the flood from a powerful \"steamer\" would have been at a\\r\\nlater period.  The consequence was that the fire was got under at once,\\r\\nand, as we have said, the engine was not required.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wirtoo,\" observed the Bloater, sententiously, \"is its own reward.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pointed to the returning engine, and looked at Little Jim with\\r\\nsolemnity; whereupon Jim displayed all his teeth, nodded approval of the\\r\\nsentiment, and--\"sk!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Little Jim,\" continued the Bloater, shaking his head gravely, \"they do\\r\\nsay--them as knows best, or thinks they does, which is all the same--\\r\\nthat there\\'s wit in silence; if so, it appears to me that you tries to\\r\\nbe too witty at times.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dun know, Bob,\" replied Jim, with a meditative look, \"much about wit\\r\\nbein\\' in silence.  I only wish there was wittles in it.  Oh! wouldn\\'t I\\r\\n\\'old my tongue, just, till I was fit to bust!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But there ain\\'t wittles in it, Jim, nor nothin\\' else worth \\'avin\\', so\\r\\ndon\\'t try it on too much to-night.  You see, I\\'m a bit down-\\'earted\\r\\nabout the thoughts o\\' this \\'ere black business, an\\' feel the want of a\\r\\ncheerin\\' word now and agin to keep up my droopin\\' spirits, d\\'ye see; so\\r\\ndon\\'t stand grinnin\\' there like a Cheshire cat, else I\\'ll--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bloater terminated the sentence in action, by squeezing Little Jim\\'s\\r\\ncap over his eyes.  He was still engaged in this act of pleasantry when\\r\\nMr Sparks and his friend Jeff appeared on the other side of the street.\\r\\nThey walked smartly past the door of the fire-station, which was shut\\r\\nby that time, the men having retired to their various domiciles for the\\r\\nnight, with the exception of the two on night duty.  They stopped at the\\r\\ncorner of the street, looked back, and stood as if conversing casually\\r\\nwith each other.  Meanwhile, the two boys shrank out of sight, and gazed\\r\\nat them like weasels peeping out of a hole.  The street, being a small\\r\\nback one, was quite deserted at that hour.  After talking in low tones\\r\\nfor a few seconds, and making sure, as Jeff said, that the coast was\\r\\nclear, the incendiaries shrunk round the corner and disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Jim,\" whispered the Bloater, \"they\\'ve gone to Number 5; let\\'s\\r\\nfoller.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were uncommonly active and sly little fellows, but, despite their\\r\\nutmost efforts, they failed to gain a position of vantage from which to\\r\\nobserve the enemy without being seen.  They did, indeed, manage to make\\r\\nout that the two men were for some time busily and stealthily engaged in\\r\\nthe neighbourhood of Joe Dashwood\\'s dwelling, but what they were doing\\r\\ncould not be ascertained.  After repeated and desperate efforts to\\r\\novercome his difficulties, at the risk of his neck and to the detriment\\r\\nof his shins, the Bloater at last sat down on a doorstep within a dark\\r\\npassage, and feigned to tear his hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now ain\\'t it wexin\\'?\" he whispered, appealing to his small friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aggrawatin\\' beyond endoorance,\" replied Jim, with looks of sympathy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wot _is_ to be done?\" demanded the Bloater.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Invite a Bobby to come an\\' help us,\" suggested Jim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"H\\'m! an\\' stop \\'em in their game, p\\'raps, at a pint w\\'ere nobody could\\r\\nprove nothink against \\'em, besides bringin\\' on ourselves the purlite\\r\\ninquiry, `Wot are _you_ up to \\'ere?\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Jim looked disconsolate and said nothing, which, as the Bloater\\r\\ntestily remarked, was another of his witty rejoinders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" said Jim, \"we must just wait till the fire breaks out an\\'\\r\\nthen bust upon \\'em all of a \\'eap.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"H\\'m! much they\\'d care for _your_ bustin\\' on \\'em.  No, Jim, we must risk\\r\\na little.  Never wenter, never win, you know.  Just you go round by the\\r\\nother end of the street and creep as close as you can; you\\'re small, you\\r\\nknow, an\\' won\\'t be so easy seen as me.  Try to make out wot they\\'re up\\r\\nto and then--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then wot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"W\\'y, come back an\\' let me know.  Away!\" said the Bloater, waving his\\r\\nhand with the air of a field-marshal.\\r\\n\\r\\nJim disappeared at once and was absent about ten minutes, during which\\r\\nMaster Robert Herring sat in the dark passage biting his nails and\\r\\nfeeling really uncomfortable, as is usually the case with energetic\\r\\nspirits when reduced to unavoidable inaction.  Presently Little Jim\\r\\nreturned with, as his friend and patron remarked, his eyes like two\\r\\nsaucers, and his face as white as a sheet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hallo, Jim, wot\\'s up?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Bob!\" gasped Jim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak!\" exclaimed the Bloater, seizing him by the shoulders and shaking\\r\\nhim violently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They\\'ve got the \\'ouse choke full o\\' combustibles,\" gasped Jim in an\\r\\nexcited whisper.  \"I see \\'em stuffin\\' straw and pitch, an\\' I dun know\\r\\nwot all, through a small back winder.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So--_now\\'s_ the time for a Bobby,\" observed the Bloater, leaping up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, taint,\" said Jim, detaining him.  \"I \\'eard \\'em speak.  Oh, they\\'re\\r\\nsly dogs!  They ain\\'t a-goin\\' to run away arter settin\\' it alight.\\r\\nThey\\'re goin\\' to run to the station, rouse up the men, an\\' help to put\\r\\nit out! an\\' one of \\'em says, `Jeff,\\' says \\'e, larfin\\', `won\\'t we lend\\r\\n\\'em a good \\'and to put it hout neither!\\'  And the other grinned, an\\'\\r\\nsays, `Yes, Phil, we\\'ll do our best, an\\' it\\'ll go hard if I can\\'t in the\\r\\nmiddle o\\' the smoke an\\' flames, git a chance at Joe to--.\\'  \\'E didn\\'t\\r\\nsay no more, but \\'e drewed \\'is finger across \\'is throat; but the one as\\r\\n\\'e called Phil said, `No, Jeff, no, I\\'ll split on you if you do.  It\\'s\\r\\nquite enough to give \\'im a rap over the \\'ead!\\'  I didn\\'t wait to \\'ear no\\r\\nmore arter that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They\\'re safe not to go off, then,\" observed the Bloater; \"nevertheless,\\r\\nwe must take a Bobby into our confidence now, for the case begins to\\r\\nlook ugly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile these things were transpiring in the dark and silent night outside\\r\\nof \"Number 5,\" the inmates of that modest mansion were buried in\\r\\nprofound repose.  Joe Dashwood, on leaving the station for the night,\\r\\nand going home, had found that Molly had already retired, and was asleep\\r\\nin the inner room with the Rosebud in her bosom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter contemplating this pleasant sight for a few minutes he returned to\\r\\nthe outer or kitchen-dino-drawing-room, where he found a cot\\r\\nextemporised out of four chairs and a baking-board, on which reposed the\\r\\nsturdy little figure of Fred Crashington.  That enthusiastic amateur\\r\\nfireman had been invited to take up his quarters at Number 5, until his\\r\\nfather should be out of danger, and having devoted his energies during\\r\\nthe entire day, along with the Rosebud, in a futile effort to extinguish\\r\\nthat obstinate fire in the cupboard, had at length been persuaded to\\r\\nretire exhausted to the baking-board, where he lay with a happy smile on\\r\\nhis parted lips, and his right arm embracing the quaint old helmet, with\\r\\nwhich he was wont to extinguish his little head.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing unusually tired that night, but not sleepy, Joe resolved to solace\\r\\nhimself with a pipe before lying down.  He threw off his coat, vest, and\\r\\nbraces, pulled up his flannel shirt, so as to let it hang comfortably\\r\\nloose over the waistband of his trousers, sat down in an armchair in\\r\\nfront of the fire, filled his pipe, and began to smoke.  His intention\\r\\nwas to \"take a few whiffs and then turn in,\" but the influence of the\\r\\ntobacco appeared to be soporific, for he soon began to nod; then he\\r\\nremoved his pipe, stared earnestly at the fire, and established quite a\\r\\nnodding acquaintance with it.  Presently he dropped his chin on his\\r\\nbroad chest and snored steadily.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this condition of repose he was awakened by a sensation as if of\\r\\nsuffocation by smoke.  This was such an extremely natural, not to say\\r\\nhabitual, state of things with Joe, that he was at least a couple of\\r\\nseconds in realising the fact that there was unusual cause for haste and\\r\\nvigorous action.  Like a giant refreshed Joe leaped to his work.  Every\\r\\nfibre of his huge frame was replete with energy, and his heart beat\\r\\nstrong, but it beat steadily; not a vestige of a _flutter_ was there,\\r\\nfor his head was clear and cool.  He knew exactly what to do.  He knew\\r\\nexactly what was being done.  Surprise did, indeed, fill him when he\\r\\n_reflected_ that it was his own house which had caught fire, but that\\r\\ndid not for a moment confuse him as to the certainty that the engine\\r\\nmust be already out, and his comrades rushing to his assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe strode to the door and opened it.  A volume of dense black smoke,\\r\\nfollowed by sheets of flame drove him back.  At the same moment loud\\r\\nshouts were heard outside, and a shriek came from the inner room.  Joe\\r\\ndashed towards it.  In passing, he pulled Fred off the baking-board, and\\r\\nat the same moment seized the curious old helmet, and almost\\r\\ninstinctively clapped it on his own head.  There was a back door to the\\r\\nhouse.  Joe grasped his wife, and the Rosebud, and the bedclothes in one\\r\\nmighty embrace, and bore the whole bundle towards this back door.\\r\\nBefore he reached it it was dashed open by Bob Clazie, who sprang in\\r\\nwith the \"branch.\"  Bob, having been roused to a fire so near at hand,\\r\\nhad not taken time to go through the usual process of putting on his\\r\\nuniform.  He, like Joe, was in dishabille.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here, take care of \\'em.  Let go the branch; I\\'ll look after it.  Foul\\r\\nplay here.  Let the police look out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe said this sharply as he thrust the bundle containing his wife into\\r\\nBob\\'s arms, and, picking up the Rosebud, who had slipped out, clapped\\r\\nher on Bob\\'s back.  Bob made for the back staircase, while Joe picked up\\r\\nthe branch, and turning his head in the direction of the open door,\\r\\nshouted in the voice of a stentor, \"Down with \\'er!\"  Meanwhile, Fred,\\r\\nwho had a vague impression that the fire in the cupboard had got to a\\r\\npowerful head at last, picked up the hose and looked on with a sleepy\\r\\nsmile.\\r\\n\\r\\nObedient to the order, the water rushed on, filled and straightened the\\r\\nhose, threw Fred on his back on the floor, and caused the nozzle to\\r\\nquiver as Joe directed it to the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then a man dashed into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lend a hand here,\" cried Joe glancing round.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe saw in a moment by the man\\'s look that he meant mischief.  Instantly\\r\\nhe turned the nozzle full in his face.  Jeff, for it was he, fell as if\\r\\nhe had been shot, and was partly washed, partly rolled down the back\\r\\nstaircase, at the foot of which a policeman was prepared to receive him,\\r\\nbut Jeff sprang up, knocked down the policeman, and fled.  Seeing this,\\r\\nMr Sparks took alarm, and was about to follow when the Bloater suddenly\\r\\nsprang at his throat and Little Jim caught him by the legs.  He quickly\\r\\ndisengaged himself, however, and ran off at full speed, closely followed\\r\\nby his young tormentors and two policemen, besides a miscellaneous crowd\\r\\nof hooting and yelling lads and boys.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an exciting chase that ensued.  The two policemen were young and\\r\\nstrong, and for some time kept pretty near the fugitive, but gradually\\r\\nthey fell behind, and, by doubling through several narrow streets,\\r\\nSparks threw them off the scent.  As for the crowd, the greater part of\\r\\nthose who composed it gave in after a short run.  But the Bloater and\\r\\nLittle Jim were not thus to be got rid of.  They were fleet of foot and\\r\\neasily kept Mr Sparks in view, though he made desperate efforts to\\r\\ncatch them, as well as to get away from them.  The two boys were so\\r\\npersevering that they followed him all the way to Thames Street, and,\\r\\njust when the unhappy man thought he had at length eluded them, they set\\r\\nup the cry of \"Stop thief!\" and gave chase again with a new force of\\r\\npolicemen and roughs at their heels.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning abruptly into a dark passage, Sparks rushed upstairs, burst open\\r\\na door and fell exhausted on the floor of the cheerless room occupied by\\r\\npoor Martha Reading.  Almost at the same moment the two boys, who were\\r\\nat least a hundred yards in advance of the other pursuers, sprang into\\r\\nthe room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! run you down at last, have we?\" gasped the Bloater.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor startled Martha, leaping at once to the conclusion that he was\\r\\npursued, fell on her knees, and, in a voice of agonising entreaty,\\r\\nbegged the boys to have mercy on him!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eh! hallo! what?\" exclaimed the Bloater, taken by surprise.  Then,\\r\\nunder a sudden impulse, he dashed out of the room followed by Little\\r\\nJim, and rushed into the street just as the first of the crowd came up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This way!  Straight on! hooray!\" he shouted, leading off the crowd in\\r\\nthe direction of the river.  The crowd followed.  The Bloater led them\\r\\ninto a maze of intricate back streets; shot far ahead of them, and then,\\r\\ndoubling, like a hare, into a retired corner, stood chuckling there\\r\\nwhile the shouting crowd swept by.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a few minutes, Little Jim was utterly bereft of speech, owing to a\\r\\ncompound of amazement, delight, excitement and exhaustion.  After a\\r\\nlittle time he said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, this _is_ a lark!  But, I say, Bloater, d\\'ye think it was right\\r\\nto let \\'im off like that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'s let \\'im off, stoopid?\" retorted the Bloater.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t I know \\'is name--at least part of it; an\\' the \\'abitation of \\'is\\r\\nwife, or sweet-\\'eart, or sister, or suthin\\' o\\' that sort?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, ah, werry true,\" replied Little Jim, with a terminating \"sk!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, that bein\\' \\'ow it is, we han\\'t let \\'im off just yet, d\\'ye see?\\r\\nSo, now we\\'ll go an\\' turn in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that observation the Bloater and Little Jim went away to search for\\r\\nand appropriate some convenient place of repose for the night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeated by the fire-side of Joe Dashwood\\'s new abode--for the old one,\\r\\nalthough not quite \"burnt out,\" was uninhabitable--Bob Clazie chatted\\r\\nand smoked his pipe contentedly.  At the conclusion of a remark, he\\r\\nlooked up in Mrs Dashwood\\'s puzzled face, and said, \"That\\'s \\'ow it is,\\r\\nd\\'ye see?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I don\\'t see,\" replied Mary, with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No? well, now, that _is_ koorious.  W\\'y, it\\'s as plain as the nose on\\r\\nmy face.  See here.  As the law now stands, there is no public authority\\r\\nto inwestigate the cause o\\' fires in London; well, wot\\'s the consikence,\\r\\nw\\'y, that there are regular gangs of scoundrels who make it their\\r\\nbusiness to arrange fires for their own adwantage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, that\\'s just what I don\\'t understand,\" said Mary, knitting her\\r\\npretty brows; \"what advantage _can_ it be to any one to set fire to a\\r\\nhouse, except to pick-pockets who may get a chance of doing business in\\r\\nthe crowd?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, that of itself is enough to endooce some blackguards to raise a\\r\\nfire, and likewise to get the shillin\\' for bringin\\' the first noose to\\r\\nthe station; which, by the way, was the chief okipation of that willain\\r\\nPhil Sparks, I\\'m pretty sure.  But here\\'s \\'ow it is.  The swindlers I\\r\\nspeak of, go an\\' take \\'ouses--the further from fire-stations the better.\\r\\nThen they furnishes the \\'ouses, arter which they insures \\'em.  In the\\r\\ncourse of a short time they removes most of the furniture in a quiet\\r\\nway, and then set the \\'ouses alight, themselves escapin\\', p\\'r\\'aps, in\\r\\nnothin\\' but their night clothes.  So, you see, they gits the insurance,\\r\\nwhich more than pays for all the furniture they had bought, besides\\r\\nwhich they \\'ave a good deal of the furniture itself to sell or do wot\\r\\nthey please with.  That\\'s one way in which fires are raised,--ain\\'t it\\r\\nJoe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe, who sat smoking in silence on the other side of the fire, nodded,\\r\\nand, turning his head round, advised Fred Crashington and little May to\\r\\nmake \"less row.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we can\\'t put it out widout a row!\" remonstrated the Rosebud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! have you found a fire in _this_ cupboard, as well as in the one\\r\\no\\' the old house?\" asked Joe, with a laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Iss, iss; an\\' it\\'s a far wuss fire than the last one!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s your sort!\" cried Fred; \"now then, May, don\\'t stand jawin\\'\\r\\nthere, but down with number two.  Look alive!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! chips o\\' the old blocks, I see,\" said Bob Clazie, with a grin.\\r\\n\"Well, as I was sayin\\', there\\'s another class o\\' men, not so bad as the\\r\\nfirst, but bad enough, who are indooced to go in for this crime of\\r\\nfire-raisin\\'--arson they calls it, but why so is beyond me to diskiver.\\r\\nA needy tradesman, for instance, when at his wits\\'-end for money, can\\'t\\r\\nhelp thinkin\\' that a lucky spark would put him all right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how could the burning of his goods put him all right?\" demanded\\r\\nMary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"W\\'y, \\'e don\\'t want goods, you know, \\'e wants to sell \\'is goods an\\' so\\r\\ngit _money_; but nobody will buy, so \\'e can\\'t sell, nor git money, yet\\r\\nmoney must be \\'ad, for creditors won\\'t wait.  Wot then?  All the goods\\r\\nare insured against fire.  Well, make a bonfire of \\'em, redoose \\'em all\\r\\nto hashes, an\\' of coorse the insurance companies is bound to pay up, so\\r\\n\\'e gits rid of the goods, gits a lot o\\' ready money in \\'and, pays off\\r\\n\\'is creditors, and p\\'r\\'aps starts fresh in a noo business!  Now, a\\r\\npublic officer to inwestigate such matters would mend things to some\\r\\nextent, though \\'e mightn\\'t exactly cure \\'em.  Some time ago the Yankees,\\r\\nI\\'m told, appointed a officer they called a fire-marshal in some of\\r\\ntheir cities, and it\\'s said that the consikence was a sudden an\\'\\r\\nextraor\\'nary increase in the conwictions for arson, followed by a\\r\\nremarkable decrease in the number o\\' fires!  They\\'ve got some-thin\\' o\\'\\r\\nthe same sort in France, an\\' over all the chief towns o\\' Europe, I\\r\\nb\\'lieve, but we don\\'t need no such precautions in London.  We\\'re rich,\\r\\nyou know, an\\' can afford to let scamps burn right an\\' left.  It ain\\'t\\r\\nworth our while to try to redooce the number of _our_ fires.  We\\'ve\\r\\nalready got an average of about five fires every twenty-four hours in\\r\\nLondon.  Why should we try to make \\'em less, w\\'en they furnishes \\'ealthy\\r\\nwork to such fine fellows as Joe and me and the police--not to mention\\r\\nthe fun afforded to crossin\\'-sweepers and other little boys, whose chief\\r\\nenjoyment in life would be gone if there was no fires.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If _I_ had the making of the laws,\" exclaimed Mary, flushing with\\r\\nindignation as she thought of her own recent risks and losses in\\r\\nconsequence of fire-raising, \"I\\'d have every man that set light to his\\r\\nhouse _hanged_!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah; an\\' if \\'e could also be draw\\'d and quartered,\" added Bob, \"and \\'ave\\r\\nthe bits stuck on the weathercocks of Saint Paul\\'s, or atop of Temple\\r\\nBar, it would serve \\'im right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must have you into Parliament some day, Molly,\" said Joe, with a\\r\\nsmile.  \"Women are tryin\\' hard, I believe, to get the right to vote for\\r\\nmembers; w\\'y not go the whole hog and vote themselves in?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They\\'d make splendid firemen too,\" said Clazie, \"at least if they were\\r\\nonly half as vigorous as your little May.  By the way, Joe,\" continued\\r\\nBob, \"has Sparks been took yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet.  It is rumoured that the crossin\\'-sweeper who chased him down\\r\\nso smartly, suddenly favoured his escape at last, from some\\r\\nunaccountable cause or other.  I suppose that Sparks bribed him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re sure it was Sparks, are you?\" inquired Bob.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite sure.  It is true I only saw his confederate, but one of the men\\r\\nwho had often seen Sparks in company with Crashington, his\\r\\nbrother-in-law, knew him at once and saw him run off, with the boys\\r\\nafter him.  He\\'s a bad lot, but I hope he\\'ll escape for poor Mrs\\r\\nCrashington\\'s sake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And _I_ hope he won\\'t escape, for poor Martha Reading\\'s sake!\" said\\r\\nMary with much decision of tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s his sweet-\\'eart--a friend of Molly\\'s!\" said Joe to Bob in\\r\\nexplanation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point in the conversation, Master Fred Crashington, in his\\r\\nfrantic efforts to reach an elevated part of the cupboard, fell\\r\\nbackwards, drawing a shelf and all its contents on the top of himself\\r\\nand May.  Neither of them was hurt, though both were much frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think _that_ must have put the fire out at last,\" said Joe, with a\\r\\nlaugh, as he took the panting rosebud on his knee and smoothed her soft\\r\\nlittle head.  \"We\\'ll sit quiet now and have a chat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA knock at the outer door here called Mrs Dashwood from the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fire!\" exclaimed May, holding up her finger and listening with eager\\r\\nexpectation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, little woman,\" said Joe, \"they would ring loud if it was fire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Mrs Dashwood opened the door and found herself confronted by\\r\\na boy, with his hands in his pockets and his cap thrown in a reckless\\r\\nway half on the side and half on the back of his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I suppose you are the boy Herring, sent here by Miss Reading,\" said\\r\\nMrs Dashwood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, as to that, ma\\'am, you must be guided by taste.  I\\'ve \\'eard of\\r\\nmen of my years an\\' standin\\' bein\\' styled \\'obble-de-\\'oys.  My name,\\r\\nlikewise, is open to question.  Some of my friends calls me \\'Erring--\\r\\nothers of \\'em, Raw \\'Erring--others, again, the Bloater.  But I\\'m in no\\r\\nwise partikler, I _did_ come from Miss Reading to \\'ave an interview with\\r\\nMrs Dashwood--whom--I presoom--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the Bloater laid his hand on his heart and made a courtly bow.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Dashwood laughed, and said, \"come in, boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a pal, ma\\'am--a chum--a--in fact a _friend_--may I--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout finishing his sentence or waiting for a reply, the Bloater gave\\r\\na sharp whistle, and Little Jim stood by his side as if by magical\\r\\ninfluence, looking the embodiment of united innocence and impudence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come in, both of you, and make haste,\" said Mary, ushering them into a\\r\\nsmall empty room.  \"Now, boy--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bloater, ma\\'am, if you \\'ave no objection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Bloater, our communication with each other must be brief and to\\r\\nthe point, because--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am--sharp and short,\" interrupted the Bloater--\"reasons not\\r\\nrequired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSmiling in spite of herself, Mrs Dashwood said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know Mr Sparks, and can--can--in short, give him into the hands of\\r\\njustice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I knowed w\\'ere justice was,\" said the Bloater, sternly, \"p\\'raps I\\r\\nmight give Mr Sparks into \\'is \\'ands, but I don\\'t.  It\\'s my opinion that\\r\\n_justice_ ain\\'t finished yet.  They\\'ve made \\'is \\'ands no doubt--and\\r\\npretty strong ones they are too--but they \\'aven\\'t give \\'im brains yet.\\r\\n\\'Ows\\'ever, to make a long story short, \\'as \\'Amlet said to \\'is father\\'s\\r\\nghost, w\\'ich was prince of Timbuctoo, I _do_ know Mr Sparks, and I\\r\\n_can_ give \\'im into the \\'ands of the p\\'lice--wot then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Do it_!\" said Mrs Dashwood, with sudden intensity of feeling and\\r\\nmanner, \"Do it, boy--\" (\"Bloater,\" murmured the lad), \"do it, Bloater.\\r\\nOh! you have no idea what a blessing it would be to--to--to--a poor,\\r\\ndear girl who is mad--infatuated and, and--then, he is _such_ a\\r\\nscoundrel; such a fire-raiser, deceiver, villain--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t appear to like \\'im yourself,\" remarked the Bloater.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said this so quietly and with an air of calmness which contrasted so\\r\\nstrongly with Mrs Dashwood\\'s excitement, that Little Jim gave vent to\\r\\nan irresistible \"sk\" and blew his nose violently to distract attention\\r\\nfrom it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you not consent to give up a thorough scoundrel, who every one\\r\\ncondemns?\" demanded Mrs Dashwood, with sudden indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, that depends--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bloater,\" said Mary, with increasing earnestness, \"I cannot bribe you--\\r\\nI have not the means even if I had the will; but I would not if I could.\\r\\nI scorn bribery.  If you will not aid me for the sake of a poor,\\r\\nhelpless, infatuated girl, who is on the brink of ruin--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Missis Dashwood,\" said the Bloater, with a look of serio-comic dignity,\\r\\n\"I scorns bribery as much as you does.  `No bribery, no c\\'rupt\\'ons, no\\r\\nPopery,\\' them\\'s my mottoes--besides a few more that there\\'s no occasion\\r\\nto mention.  W\\'ether or not I gives \\'im up depends on circumstances.\\r\\nNow, I s\\'pose _you_ want\\'s \\'im took an\\' bagged, \\'cause \\'e ain\\'t fit for\\r\\nyour friend Martha Reading--we\\'ll drop the `Miss\\' if you please.  Well,\\r\\nwot I want to know is, does Martha think as you does?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course not, boy.  No doubt she knows that he is an unworthy\\r\\nscoundrel, but she can\\'t prevail on herself to forsake him; so, you see,\\r\\nI want to help her a little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, I see--yes--I see.  Well, missis, I\\'ll take it into consideration.\\r\\nCome along, Jim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout waiting for a reply, the Bloater quitted the house abruptly,\\r\\nfollowed by his friend.  He walked very fast towards the City--so fast\\r\\nthat Jim was compelled to trot--and was unusually silent.  He went\\r\\nstraight to the abode of Martha Reading, and found her sewing and\\r\\nweeping.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! _he\\'s_ bin with you, I see,\" said the Bloater.  \"Did \\'e ask you to\\r\\nlet \\'im \\'ide \\'ere?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ye-es;\" said Martha, hesitating; \"but I refused to do it.  God knows\\r\\nhow willing--how willing--I would be to shelter and save him if I\\r\\ncould!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you shelter a _guilty_ man?\" demanded the Bloater, sternly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know that he is guilty,\" said Martha, evasively.  \"But, tell\\r\\nme, what did Mrs Dashwood want with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s a private matter,\" said the Bloater, frowning.  \"You can\\'t turn\\r\\nme off the scent like that.  I ask you, ain\\'t it right to \\'and a guilty\\r\\nman over to justice?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is,\" replied Martha, wiping her eyes, \"but it is also right to\\r\\ntemper justice with mercy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say, that\\'s drawin\\' it rather fine, ain\\'t it?\" said the Bloater,\\r\\nscrewing up one eyebrow and turning towards Little Jim; but that small\\r\\nyouth was so touched with the poor girl\\'s sorrow and so attracted by her\\r\\ncountenance, that he had quite forgotten his patron for the moment.\\r\\nGoing towards her, he laid his dirty little hand on her knee, and looked\\r\\nup in her face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless you, dear boy,\" she said, patting him on the head, \"you are\\r\\nthe first that has given me a look of sympathy for many--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe broke down suddenly, burst into a flood of tears, and, seizing the\\r\\nchild in her arms, absolutely hugged him!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hallo! hallo!\" cried the Bloater, when Little Jim was released.  \"I\\r\\nsay, you know, come, this sort o\\' thing will never do.  W\\'y, its\\r\\nhoutrageous.  Come along with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSaying which he seized Little Jim by the collar, dragged him out into\\r\\nthe street, and hurried him along.  Presently he released him, but\\r\\nwithout slackening his pace, and said, \"Now, Jim, you an\\' I shall go and\\r\\npay _another_ wisit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey traversed several small streets, which seemed to be influenced by a\\r\\ntendency to gravitate towards the Thames; while the river, as if in\\r\\nsympathy, appeared to meet them more than half way in the shape of mud.\\r\\nAs they proceeded, huge warehouses frowned above, having doors high up\\r\\non their blank faces where windows ought to have been, with no steps\\r\\nleading thereto, but in some cases with huge block tackles pendent\\r\\ntherefrom, suggestive of the idea that the owners were wont to drop the\\r\\nenormous hooks and fish for passers-by.  These streets naturally became\\r\\nmore nautical in some respects as they neared the river.  Old bits of\\r\\ntimber lay here and there among old cordage in little yards, where the\\r\\nowners appeared to deal in small-coal and miscellaneous filth.\\r\\nElsewhere, worn-out anchors held tenaciously to the mud, as if afraid of\\r\\nbeing again pressed into service and carried off to sea.  Everything was\\r\\ncold, dismal, dreary, disreputable; and here, in the dirtiest corner of\\r\\nthe smallest possible yard, the Bloater found a half-concealed door that\\r\\nmight have been the portal to a dog-kennel or pig-sty.  Opening it he\\r\\nentered, and Little Jim followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aspect of things inside was not attractive.  Dirt, damp, and rubbish\\r\\nprevailed in the room, which was just big enough to permit of a tall man\\r\\nlying down, but not high enough to admit of his standing up.  An\\r\\nuncommonly small four-post bed almost filled the apartment, at the foot\\r\\nof which, on the floor and half-reclining against one of the posts, lay\\r\\nPhil Sparks, either dead-drunk or asleep, or both.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bloater glanced back at Little Jim with a look of satisfaction, and\\r\\nheld up his finger to enjoin silence.  Peering round the room, which was\\r\\nlighted by a farthing candle stuck in the neck of a pint bottle, he\\r\\nobserved a piece of rope lying among some rubbish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! this\\'ll do,\" he whispered, as he took it up, and, with wonderful\\r\\nrapidity, made a loop on it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Jim, you be ready to cut and run if he should waken before I \\'ave\\r\\n\\'im fast.  Don\\'t mind me; I\\'ll look arter myself.  An\\' wotever you do,\\r\\n_don\\'t holler for the bobbies_.  Mind that, else I\\'ll strangle you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this advice and caution, the Bloater advanced toward the recumbent\\r\\nman, and passed the rope softly round his body, including his arms and\\r\\nthe bedpost in the coil.  Drawing it suddenly tight, he hastily made it\\r\\nfast; but there was no occasion for haste, for the sleep of the man was\\r\\nso profound that the action did not awake him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hall right--fus\\' rate,\" said the Bloater aloud, as he wound the rope\\r\\nround and round Sparks, so as to make him doubly secure.  \"Nothin\\' could\\r\\nbe better.  Now, Jim, I\\'m goin\\' for to preach a sermon to-night--a sort\\r\\no\\' discoorse.  You never heard me preach, did you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Jim, who, despite his love of mischief, was somewhat alarmed at\\r\\nthe strange proceedings of his friend and patron, looked at him with a\\r\\nmingled expression of fear and glee, and shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you shall \\'ear.  Moreover, I \\'ope that you\\'ll profit by wot you\\r\\n\\'ears.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSaying this, he advanced his hand towards the sleeping man\\'s face, and,\\r\\ncausing his thumb to act as a trigger to his middle finger, gave him\\r\\nsuch a flip on the point of his nose, that he awoke with a tremendous\\r\\nroar.  Suddenly he became pale as death--supposing, no doubt, that he\\r\\nhad betrayed himself--and glanced towards the door with a bewildered\\r\\nstare.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you needn\\'t alarm yourself,\" said the Bloater, placing a stool in\\r\\nfront of his victim, and sitting down thereon, with a hand on each knee,\\r\\n\"it ain\\'t the bobbies.  If you keep quiet, there\\'s no fear of _them_ in\\r\\nthis neighbourhood.  I can call \\'em w\\'en I wants \\'em.  There\\'s nobody\\r\\nbut me and Little Jim \\'ere--your friends, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBecoming suddenly convinced of the truth of this, Phil Sparks, who was\\r\\nvery drunk, made so desperate an effort to free himself that he nearly\\r\\noverturned the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you are anxious to see the bobbies, are you?  Well, go an\\' call \\'em\\r\\nin, Jim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJim rose to obey, and the man became instantly quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ho! you\\'re reasonable now, are you?  That\\'s well.  You needn\\'t call \\'em\\r\\nin yet, Jim.  We\\'ll grant \\'im a reprieve.  Fetch that stool, an\\' sit\\r\\ndown beside me--there.  Now, Mr Sparks, _alias_ Blazes, no doubt\\r\\n_you\\'re_ a precious specimen of hinnocent \\'unmanity, ain\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSparks made no reply, but scowled at the boy with a look of deadly\\r\\nhatred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, upon my word,\" resumed the Bloater, with a smile, \"if I kep\\' a\\r\\nmenagerie, I\\'d offer you five \\'undred a year to represent a Tasmanian\\r\\ndevil.  But look \\'ere, now, I\\'ve no time to waste with you; I come \\'ere\\r\\nto give you a bit of my mind.  You\\'re a fire-raiser, you are.  Ah! you\\r\\nmay well wince an\\' grow w\\'ite.  You\\'d grow w\\'iter still, with a rope\\r\\nround your neck, if you wos left to _my_ tender mercies, you w\\'ite\\r\\nlivered villain! for I knows you; I\\'ve watched you; I\\'ve found you hout;\\r\\nan\\' I\\'ve only got to \\'old up my little finger to cut your pretty little\\r\\ncareer prematoorly short.  You don\\'t seem to like that?  No, I didn\\'t\\r\\nexpect you would.  This young man, whose \\'art is big, if \\'is body\\'s\\r\\nsmall, knows as much about you as I do.  Two witnesses, you see; but you\\r\\n_ain\\'t_ left to _our_ tender mercies; and if you wants to know who\\r\\ndelivered you from us, and from the maginstrates, and Jack Ketch,\\r\\n_alias_ Calcraft, I replies, _Martha Reading_.  Ha! you look surprised.\\r\\nQuite nat\\'ral.  You\\'ve deserved very different treatment from that young\\r\\nooman, an\\' didn\\'t expect that she\\'d return good for evil, I s\\'pose.\\r\\nThat\\'s because you don\\'t know \\'er; you don\\'t understand \\'er, you\\r\\nmiserable lump of selfish stoopidity.  \\'Ows\\'ever, as I said before, I\\r\\nain\\'t a-goin\\' to waste no more time with you.  But let me, before\\r\\nbiddin\\' you adoo, give you a caution.  Remember, that _I\\'ve got my eye\\r\\non you_.  Just one word more.  W\\'en you thinks of _me_, don\\'t think of\\r\\none as \\'as got any tender mercies, for I ain\\'t got none; not a scrap of\\r\\n\\'em, nor nothin\\' of the sort.  W\\'en you wants to know the true cause of\\r\\nyour bein\\' let off, just think of two words--_Martha Reading_!  She\\r\\nknows nothin\\' o\\' wot I\\'m doin\\', nevertheless, _she\\'s_ done it!  Let \\'er\\r\\nname ring in your ears, an\\' thunder in your brain, and burn in your\\r\\n\\'art, till it consooms your witals or your willany!  Now, Jim,\"\\r\\nconcluded the Bloater, rising and opening a large clasp-knife, \"you go\\r\\nto the door, open it wide, an\\' stan\\' by to cut, and run.  This gen\\'lm\\'n\\r\\nain\\'t to be trusted w\\'en free.  Are you ready?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hall ready,\" replied Jim.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bloater cut the cord that bound Phil Sparks, and darted from the\\r\\nroom.  Before the man could disentangle himself from its coils, the boys\\r\\nwere safe from pursuit, quietly wending their way through the crowded\\r\\nthoroughfares of the great city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral months passed away.  During this period Phil Sparks kept in\\r\\nclose hiding, because, although the Bloater, true to his promise,\\r\\nrefrained from giving information against him, there were others who\\r\\nknew and suspected him, and who had no visions of an imploring Martha to\\r\\nrestrain them in their efforts to deliver him into the hands of justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this period, also, Ned Crashington recovered his wonted health\\r\\nand vigour, while his wife, to some extent, recovered her senses, and,\\r\\ninstead of acting as an irritant blister on her husband, began really to\\r\\naim at unanimity.  The result was, that Ned\\'s love for her, which had\\r\\nonly been smothered a little, burst forth with renewed energy, and\\r\\nMaggie found that in peace there is prosperity.  It is not to be\\r\\nsupposed that Maggie was cured all at once.  She was not an angel--only\\r\\nan energetic and self-willed woman.  She therefore broke out now and\\r\\nthen in her old style; but, on the whole, she was much improved, and the\\r\\nstalwart fireman no longer sought martyrdom in the flames.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this period, too, the men of the Red Brigade held on the even\\r\\ntenor of their furious fiery way; not, indeed, scatheless, but with a\\r\\nmuch smaller amount of damage to life and limb than might have been\\r\\nexpected in a service where the numerical strength was so low--only\\r\\nabout 380 men--and where the duty, night and day, was so severe and\\r\\nhazardous.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout this time, their Chief\\'s \"Report\" for the past year was issued,\\r\\nand it revealed a few facts which are worthy of record.  It stated that\\r\\nthere had been altogether 1946 fires in London during the past twelve\\r\\nmonths; that is, an average of a little more than five fires every\\r\\ntwenty-four hours.  Of these 1670 had been slight, while 276 were\\r\\nserious.  In these fires 186 persons had been seriously endangered, of\\r\\nwhom 153 were rescued by the men of the Red Brigade, while 33 perished,\\r\\ndespite the most gallant efforts to save them.  The Report showed,\\r\\nfurther, that there were in London at that time, (and it is much the\\r\\nsame still), 50 fire-engine stations, 25 land steam fire-engines, 85\\r\\nmanual fire-engines, 2 floating steam fire-engines on the Thames, and\\r\\n104 fire-escapes.  The number of journeys made by the fire-engines\\r\\nduring the year was 8127, and the total distance run was 21,914 miles.\\r\\nThis, the reader will observe, implies an enormous amount of labour\\r\\nperformed by the 380 heroes who constitute the Red Brigade, and who,\\r\\nalthough thus heavily overtaxed, were never heard to murmur or complain.\\r\\nThat they suffered pretty frequently and severely might have been\\r\\nexpected.  In truth, it is a marvel that they did not suffer more.  The\\r\\nReport showed that, among them all in the course of the year, they had\\r\\nreceived 36 contusions, dislocations, fractures, and such like injuries;\\r\\n22 incised, lacerated, and punctured wounds; 18 injuries to eyes, head,\\r\\nand arms; 2 internal injuries; 22 sprains, and, strange to say, only 4\\r\\nburns and scalds, making 104 injuries altogether, but no deaths.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings being in this condition, the brigade lay on its oars, so to\\r\\nspeak, awaiting \"a call,\" one bleak evening in November, when everything\\r\\nin London looked so wet, and cold, and wretched, that some people went\\r\\nthe length of saying that a good rousing fire would be quite a cheering\\r\\nsight for the eyes to rest upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the West-End station, to which we have directed attention more than\\r\\nonce in this tale, Joe Dashwood, and Ned Crashington, and Bob Clazie,\\r\\nwith his brother David, and some more of the men, were seated in the\\r\\ninner lobby, discussing the news of the day, and settling the affairs of\\r\\nthe nation to their own entire satisfaction.  The Bloater and Little Jim\\r\\nwere also there, hanging about the door.  These fire-eating youths had\\r\\nbecome so fond of the locality and of the men, that they had taken to\\r\\nsweeping a crossing in the neighbourhood, and were wont to cheer their\\r\\nspirits, during intervals of labour, by listening to, or chaffing, the\\r\\nfiremen, and following them, when possible, to fires.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly the rattle of the telegraphic bell roused the men.  This was so\\r\\ncommon an occurrence, that it scarcely called forth a passing remark.\\r\\nOne of them, however, rose with alacrity, and, replying to the signal,\\r\\nread off the message.  We cannot give the precise words of the telegram,\\r\\nbut it was to the effect that a fire had broken out at Saint Katharine\\'s\\r\\nDocks, and that all available force was to be sent out at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn hearing this there was unusual promptitude in the movements of the\\r\\nfiremen.  At all times they are bound, on pain of a heavy fine, to turn\\r\\nout in three minutes after receiving the call to a fire.  Sometimes they\\r\\nsucceed in turning out in less.  It was so on the present occasion.\\r\\nMention of a fire anywhere near the docks has much the same effect on\\r\\nthe Red Brigade as the order to march to the field of Waterloo had on\\r\\nthe British army.  The extreme danger; the inflammable nature of the\\r\\ngoods contained in the huge and densely-packed warehouses; the proximity\\r\\nto the shipping; the probability of a pitched battle with the flames;\\r\\nthe awful loss of property, and perhaps of life, if the fire should gain\\r\\nthe mastery, and the urgent need there is for hurrying all the\\r\\ndisposable force in London to the spot without delay, if the victory is\\r\\nto be gained--all these circumstances and considerations act as an\\r\\nunusually sharp spur to men, who, however, being already willing at all\\r\\ntimes to do their utmost, can only force themselves to gain a few\\r\\nadditional moments of time by their most strenuous exertions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn less than three minutes, then, our West-End engine sprang off, like a\\r\\nrocket, at full gallop, with a crack of the whip, a snort from the\\r\\nsteeds, a shout from the men to clear the way, and a cheer from the\\r\\nbystanders.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo of these bystanders started off alongside of the engine, with\\r\\nglittering eyes and flushed cheeks.  The Bloater and Little Jim had\\r\\nheard the telegraph read off, had caught the words, \"Fire--Saint\\r\\nKatharine\\'s Docks,\" and knew well what that implied.  They resolved to\\r\\nwitness the fight, and ran as if their lives depended on the race.  It\\r\\nneed scarcely be said that the engine quickly left them out of sight\\r\\nbehind, not only because the horses were fleet, but also because various\\r\\npedestrians, into whose bosoms the boys plunged in their blind haste,\\r\\ntreated them rather roughly, and retarded their progress a good deal.\\r\\nBut nothing short of a knock-down blow could have put a full stop to the\\r\\ncareer of those imps of the broom.  After innumerable hair-breadth\\r\\nescapes from \"bobbies\" and others, by agile bounds and desperate plunges\\r\\namong horses\\' legs and carriage-wheels, they reached the scene of action\\r\\nnot _very_ long after the engine with which they had set out.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was night.  The fire had been raging for some time with terrible\\r\\nfury, and had already got full possession of two large warehouses, each\\r\\nfive or six floors in height, all connected by means of double iron\\r\\nfolding-doors, and stored from basement to roof with spirits, tallow,\\r\\npalm-oil, cotton, flax, jute, and other merchandise, to the extent of\\r\\nupwards of two millions sterling in value.  The dock fire-engines had\\r\\nbeen brought to bear on the flames a few minutes after the fire was\\r\\ndiscovered.  The two floating-engines were paddled at once to the spot,\\r\\nand their powerful hydrants poured continuous streams on the flames;\\r\\nwhile, every few minutes, another and another of the land-engines came\\r\\nrattling up, until all the available force of the Red Brigade was on the\\r\\nspot, each man straining, like the hero of a forlorn hope, regardless of\\r\\nlife and limb, to conquer the terrible foe.  The Brompton and Chelsea\\r\\nvolunteer fire-brigade, and several private engines, also came up to\\r\\nlend a helping hand.  But all these engines, brave hearts, and vigorous\\r\\nproceedings, appeared at first of no avail, for the greedy flames shot\\r\\nout their tongues, hissed through water and steam, and licked up the\\r\\nrich fuel with a deep continuous roar, as if they gloated over their\\r\\nunusually splendid banquet, and meant to enjoy it to the full, despite\\r\\nman\\'s utmost efforts to oppose them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe excitement at this time was tremendous.  Every available spot of\\r\\nground or building from which the most limited view of the fire could be\\r\\nobtained, was crowded to excess by human beings, whose upturned faces\\r\\nwere lighted more or less ruddily according to their distance from the\\r\\nfire.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt the greater proportion of the vast multitude beheld the waste\\r\\nof so much property with anxiety and regret.  Doubtless, also, many\\r\\nthoughtless ones were there who merely enjoyed the excitement, and\\r\\nlooked on it as a pyrotechnic display of unwonted splendour.  But there\\r\\nwas yet another class of men, aye, and women, whose view of the matter\\r\\nwas fitted to cause anxiety in the breasts of those who talk of\\r\\n\"elevating the masses,\" and this was by far the largest class.  The\\r\\ngreater part of them belonged to the lowest class of labourers, men\\r\\nwilling to work for their living, but who got little to do.  Amongst\\r\\nthese not one expression of regret was to be heard, though the women\\r\\nsometimes asked anxiously whether any one was likely to be hurt.  But\\r\\nlet a few of these speak for themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah,\" said an old woman, with an unintellectual style of countenance,\\r\\n\"now there will be plenty of work for poor men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" responded a rough, with a black eye, \"that\\'s true.  My blissin\\',\\r\\nas Paddy says, on a fire; it warms the cockles o\\' yer heart an\\' kapes\\r\\nyer hands busy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They\\'ve much need to be kep\\' busy, sure enough,\" remarked another man,\\r\\n\"for mine have been pretty idle for more than a week.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish,\" exclaimed another, with a bitter curse on mankind in general,\\r\\n\"that the whole Thames would go a-fire, from Westminster to Gravesend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe energy with which this was said caused a general laugh and a good\\r\\ndeal of chaff, but there was no humour in the man who spoke.  He was one\\r\\nof those of whom it is said by a periodical which ought to know, that\\r\\nhundreds of such may be seen day by day, year by year, waiting at the\\r\\ndifferent gates of the docks, in stolid weariness, for the chance of a\\r\\nday\\'s work--the wage of which is half-a-crown.  When a foreman comes to\\r\\na gate to take on a few such hands, the press of men, and the faces,\\r\\nhungry and eager beyond description, make one of the saddest of the sad\\r\\nsights to be seen even at the east end of London.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another part of the crowd, where the street was narrow, a scene of a\\r\\nmost fearful kind was being enacted.  All scoundreldom appeared to have\\r\\ncollected in that spot.  For two or three hours robbery and violence\\r\\nreigned unchecked in the very face of the police, who, reduced to\\r\\ninaction by the density of the crowd, could render little or no\\r\\nassistance to the sufferers.  Scarcely one respectably dressed person\\r\\nwas unmolested.  Hats were indiscriminately smashed over the brows of\\r\\ntheir wearers, coats were torn off their backs, and watches and purses\\r\\nviolently wrested from their owners.  In many cases there was no attempt\\r\\nat secrecy, men were knocked down and plundered with all the coolness\\r\\nand deliberation, with which we commonly pursue our lawful calling.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy degrees the perseverance and heroism of the firemen were rewarded.\\r\\nThe fire began to succumb to the copious floods with which it was\\r\\ndeluged, and, towards midnight, there was a perceptible diminution in\\r\\nthe violence of the flames.  There were, however, several temporary\\r\\noutbursts from time to time, which called for the utmost watchfulness\\r\\nand promptitude on the part of the Brigade.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring one of these a block of private dwellings nearest to the\\r\\nconflagration was set on fire.  So intent was every one on the _great_\\r\\nfire that this incidental one was not observed until it had gained\\r\\nconsiderable headway.  The buildings were very old and dry, so that,\\r\\nbefore an engine could be detached from the warehouses, it was in a\\r\\ncomplete blaze.  Most of the inhabitants escaped by the chief staircase\\r\\nbefore it became impassable, and one or two leaped from the lower\\r\\nwindows.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt chanced that Joe Dashwood\\'s engine was nearest to this house at the\\r\\ntime, and was run up to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now then, lads, look alive,\" said Joe, as the men affixed the hose and\\r\\nsuction-pipe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Out o\\' the way!\" cried Ned Crashington to two boys who appeared to be\\r\\nrather curious about the operations of the firemen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say,\" exclaimed the Bloater in great excitement, \"why--that\\'s the\\r\\n\\'ouse w\\'ere _Martha_ lives!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'s Martha?\" asked Ned, without interrupting his operation of\\r\\nscrewing on an additional length of hose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"W\\'y, the friend o\\' Joe Dashwood\\'s wife--Martha--Martha Reading, you\\r\\nknow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eh!\" exclaimed Ned, looking up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment Martha herself appeared at a window in the upper storey,\\r\\nwaving her arms and shrieking wildly for help.  Men were seen\\r\\nendeavouring to bring forward a fire-escape, but the crowd was so dense\\r\\nas to render this an unusually difficult and slow operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout uttering a word, Ned Crashington dashed up the blazing\\r\\nstaircase.  For a moment he was lost to view, but quickly reappeared,\\r\\nattempting to cross a half-charred beam which overhung a yawning gulf of\\r\\nfire where the first and second floors had just fallen in.  Suddenly a\\r\\ndense mass of smoke surrounded him.  He staggered, threw up his arms,\\r\\nand was seen to fall headlong into the flames.  A deep groan, or cry of\\r\\nhorror, arose from the crowd, and wild shouts of \"fetch a ladder,\"\\r\\n\"bring up the escape,\" were heard, while poor Martha got out on the\\r\\nwindow-sill to avoid the flames, which were rapidly drawing towards and\\r\\nalmost scorching her.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then a man was seen to dash furiously through the crowd, he fought\\r\\nhis way madly--knocking down all who opposed him.  Gaining the door of\\r\\nthe burning house he sprang in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say,\" whispered Little Jim, in an excited voice, \"it\\'s Phil Sparks!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m glad to hear it,\" observed a quiet, broad-shouldered man, who stood\\r\\nnear two policemen, to whom he winked knowingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bloater attempted to move off, but one of the policemen detained\\r\\nhim.  The other detained Little Jim.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the crowd looked for Phil\\'s reappearance on the beam from\\r\\nwhich poor Ned Crashington had fallen, but Phil knew the house better\\r\\nthan Ned.  He gained the upper floor by a back stair, which was not\\r\\nquite impassable; seized Martha in his arms, just as she was about to\\r\\nleap into the street, and dragged her back into the smoke and flames.\\r\\nIt appeared almost certain that both must have perished; but in a few\\r\\nseconds the man was seen to descend the lower stair with the woman in\\r\\nhis arms, and in another moment a wild enthusiastic cheer burst from the\\r\\nvast multitude as he leaped into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaying Martha gently down on a doorstep, Sparks bent over her, and\\r\\nwhispered in her ear.  She appeared to have swooned, but opened her\\r\\neyes, and gazed earnestly in the face of her deliverer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Lord must have sent you to save me, Phil; He will save _you_ also,\\r\\nif you will trust Him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Forgive me, Martha, I was hard on you, but--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless you, Phil--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Clear the way there,\" cried a commanding voice; \"here, doctor, this\\r\\nway.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd opened.  A medical man came forward and examined Martha, and\\r\\npronounced her to be only slightly injured.  Several men then raised her\\r\\nand carried her towards a neighbouring house.  Phil Sparks was about to\\r\\nfollow, but the quiet man with the broad shoulders touched him gently on\\r\\nthe arm, and said that he was \"wanted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sorry to interrupt you in such a good work, but it can\\'t be helped.\\r\\nOther people can take care of her now, you know; come along.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSparks\\' first impulse was to knock the quiet man down and fly, but he\\r\\nfelt a restraining power on his other arm, and, looking round, observed\\r\\na tall policeman at his side.  As if by magic, another tall policeman\\r\\nappeared in front of him, and a third behind him.  He suddenly bent down\\r\\nhis head and suffered himself to be led away.  Seeing this, the Bloater\\r\\nand Little Jim wrenched themselves from the grasp of their respective\\r\\ncaptors, dived between the legs of the bystanders, as eels might do\\r\\namong sedges, and vanished, to their own inexpressible delight and the\\r\\ntotal discomfiture of the \"bobbies.\"  They met a few minutes later at a\\r\\nwell-known rendezvous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish \\'e \\'adn\\'t bin took,\" said the Bloater with a look of regret on\\r\\nhis expressive though dirty countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Martha!\" said Little Jim, almost crying as he thought of her.\\r\\n\"\\'Ow much d\\'you think \\'e\\'ll get, Bloater?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twenty years at least; p\\'r\\'aps go for life; you see it\\'s an aggrawated\\r\\ncase.  I\\'ve bin makin\\' partikler inquiries, and I finds \\'e\\'s bin raisin\\'\\r\\nno end o\\' fires doorin\\' the last six months--kep\\' the Red Brigade\\r\\ntrottin\\' about quite in a surprisin\\' way.  I rather fear that \\'e\\'ll be\\r\\nlet in for ever an\\' a day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bloater was not quite correct in his guess.  When the trial came on,\\r\\nto the surprise of all, especially of his \"pals,\" Phil Sparks pleaded\\r\\n_guilty_!  Partly in consideration of this, and partly on account of his\\r\\nlast courageous act in saving the girl, he was let off with fifteen\\r\\nyears penal servitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, to return from this episode.  The great fire at the docks, after\\r\\ngutting several warehouses, was finally subdued.  And what of the loss?\\r\\nA hundred thousand pounds did not cover it, and every insurance office\\r\\nin London suffered!  In addition to this, several persons lost their\\r\\nlives, while the Red Brigade, besides having some of their number more\\r\\nor less severely injured, lost one of its best and bravest men.\\r\\n\\r\\nGallant Ned Crashington\\'s fighting days were over.  His mangled remains\\r\\nwere gathered up next morning, and, a few days later, were conveyed by\\r\\nhis comrades to their last resting-place.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is no easy matter to move the heart of London.  That vast\\r\\nnation-in-a-city has too many diverse interests to permit of the eyes of\\r\\nall being turned, even for a moment, upon one thing.  Nevertheless the\\r\\nfireman\\'s funeral seemed to cause the great cord to vibrate for a\\r\\nlittle.  Hundreds of thousands of people turned out to witness the\\r\\ncortege.  Ned\\'s coffin was drawn, military fashion, on one of the\\r\\nengines peculiar to his profession, with his helmet and hatchet placed\\r\\nupon the lid.  The whole of the force of the brigade that could be\\r\\nspared followed him in uniform, headed by their chief, and accompanied\\r\\nby a large detachment of the police force.  The procession was imposing,\\r\\nand the notices that appeared next day in all the papers were a touching\\r\\ntribute of respect to the self-sacrificing fireman, who, as one of these\\r\\npapers said, \"left a widow and son, in poor circumstances, to mourn his\\r\\nearly death.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, these things were soon forgotten in the rush of the world\\'s business\\r\\nby all save that widow and son, and one or two bosom friends.  Even the\\r\\nmen of the Red Brigade _appeared_ to forget the fallen hero very soon.\\r\\nWe say \"appeared,\" because there were some among them who mourned Ned as\\r\\na dear brother, chief among whom was Joe Dashwood.  But whatever the\\r\\nfeelings of the firemen might have been, theirs was a warfare that\\r\\nallowed no time for the undue indulgence or exhibition of grief.  The\\r\\nregular \"calls\" and duties went on steadily, sternly, as if nothing had\\r\\noccurred, and before Ned\\'s remains had lain a night in their last\\r\\nresting-place, many of his old comrades were out again doing fierce\\r\\nbattle with the restless and untameable flames.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER NINE.\\r\\n\\r\\nYears passed away, and with them many old things vanished, while many\\r\\nnovelties appeared, but the Red Brigade remained much as it was,\\r\\nexcepting that it was, if possible, smarter and more energetic than\\r\\never.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the lobby of our West-end station one pleasant summer evening, the\\r\\nmen sat and stood about the open door beside the trim engines and\\r\\n_materiel_ of their profession, chatting heartily as men are won\\'t to do\\r\\nwhen in high health and spirits.  There were new faces among them, but\\r\\nthere were also several that had long been familiar there.  The stalwart\\r\\nform of Joe Dashwood was there, so little altered by time that there was\\r\\nnothing about him to tell that he was passing the period of middle-age,\\r\\nsave a few grey hairs that mingled here and there with the dark curls on\\r\\nhis temples.  Bob Clazie was there also, but he had not stood the trials\\r\\nof his profession so well as Joe--probably his constitution was not so\\r\\nstrong.  A disagreeable short cough harassed him, though he made light\\r\\nof it.  Frequent scorching, smoking, and partial suffocation had\\r\\nincreased his wrinkles and rendered his eyelids permanently red.\\r\\nNevertheless, although nearly fifty years old, Bob Clazie was still one\\r\\nof the best men in the Brigade.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe Dashwood wore a pair of brass epaulettes on his shoulders, which\\r\\nindicated that he had attained to the highest rank in the service, short\\r\\nof the chief command.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was giving directions to one of the younger men of the force, when a\\r\\ntall strapping young man, with a plain but open and singularly pleasing\\r\\ncountenance entered, and going up to him shook him warmly by the hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Bob, what\\'s the news? you seem excited this evening,\" said Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I am, Joe; and with good reason too, for several pleasant things\\r\\nhave happened to-day.  In the first place, my friend and patron--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the old gentleman with the ruddy face and the bald head?\"\\r\\ninterrupted Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and with the kind heart.  Don\\'t ever omit the kind heart, Joe, in\\r\\nyour description of him, else you\\'ll only have painted half the\\r\\nportrait.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, but the kind heart ain\\'t quite so visible at first sight as the\\r\\nruddy face and bald head, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps not; but if you watched him long enough to see him _act_, you\\'d\\r\\nperceive the kind heart as plain as if it hung at his button-hole, and\\r\\nbeat like a sixty-horse-power steam-engine _outside_ his ribs instead of\\r\\ninside,\" said the strapping young man with quite a glow of enthusiasm.\\r\\n\"Oh, if you could only see how that old gentleman labours, and strives,\\r\\nand wears himself out, in his desire to rescue what they call our Street\\r\\nArabs, you couldn\\'t help loving him as I do.  But I\\'m wandering from the\\r\\npleasant things I\\'ve got to tell about.  Through his influence my friend\\r\\nJim has obtained a good appointment on the Metropolitan Railway, which\\r\\ngives him a much better salary than he had in Skrimp\\'s office, and opens\\r\\nup a prospect of promotion; so, although it sends him underground before\\r\\nhis natural time, he says he is quite content to be buried alive,\\r\\nespecially as it makes the prospect of his union with a very small and\\r\\nexceedingly charming little girl with black eyes, not quite so remote as\\r\\nit was.  In the second place, you\\'ll be glad to hear that the directors\\r\\nof the insurance office with which I am connected have raised my salary,\\r\\ninfluenced thereto by the same old gentleman with the ruddy face, bald\\r\\nhead, and kind heart--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Coupled with your own merits, Bob,\" suggested Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know nothing about _that_,\" replied the strapping young man with a\\r\\nsmile, \"but these pleasant pieces of good fortune have enabled me and\\r\\nJim to carry out a plan which we have long cherished--to lodge together,\\r\\nwith Martha Reading as our landlady.  In truth, anticipating some such\\r\\ngood fortune as has been sent to us, we had some time ago devoted part\\r\\nof our savings to the purpose of rescuing poor Martha from that\\r\\nmiserable needlework which has been slowly killing her so long.  We have\\r\\ntaken and furnished a small house, Martha is already installed as the\\r\\nowner, and we go there to-night for the first time, as lodgers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t say so!\" exclaimed Joe, laughing; \"why, Bob, you and your\\r\\nfriend act with as much promptitude as if you had been regularly trained\\r\\nin the Fire-Brigade.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We received much of our training _from_ it, if not _in_ it,\" returned\\r\\nthe strapping young man with the plain but pleasant countenance.  \"Don\\'t\\r\\nyou remember, Joe, how perseveringly we followed you in former days when\\r\\n_I_ was the Bloater and _he_ was Little Jim?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember it!  I should think I do,\" replied Joe.  \"How glad my Mary\\r\\nwill be when she hears what you have done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that\\'s not all my news,\" continued the Bloater, (if we may presume\\r\\nto use the old name).  \"Last, but not least, Fred has asked me to be his\\r\\ngroom\\'s-man.  He wrote me a very pathetic letter about it, but omitted\\r\\nto mention the day--not to be wondered at in the circumstances.  Poor\\r\\nFred, his letter reminded me of the blotted copies which I used to write\\r\\nwith such trouble and sorrow at the training school to which my patron\\r\\nsent me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s reason for the blotted letter besides the excitement of his\\r\\napproaching marriage,\" said Joe.  \"He hurt his hand the last fire he\\r\\nattended, and it\\'s in a sling just now, so he must have taken it out,\\r\\nfor temporary duty when he wrote to you.  The truth is that Fred is too\\r\\nreckless for a fireman.  He\\'s scarcely cool enough.  But I can inform\\r\\nyou as to the day; it is Thursday next.  See that you are up to time,\\r\\nBob.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No fear of me being late,\" replied the Bloater.  \"By the way, have you\\r\\nheard of that new method of putting out fires that somebody has\\r\\ninvented?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did hear of some nonsensical plan,\" replied Joe, with a slight\\r\\nexpression of contempt, \"but I don\\'t think it worth while to pay\\r\\nattention to things o\\' this sort.  There\\'s nothin\\' can beat good cold\\r\\nwater.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m not so sure of that, Joe,\" replied his friend gravely.  \"I have\\r\\nbeen reading an account of it in the _Insurance Guardian_, and it seems\\r\\nto me that there is something worth attending to in the new plan.  It\\r\\nlooks as if there was life in it, for a company is to be got up called\\r\\nthe `Fire and Water Company.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what _is_ this new plan?\" asked Joe, sending forth a violent puff\\r\\nfrom his pipe, as if to indicate that it would all end in smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'m not sure that I\\'ve got a correct notion of it myself, but my\\r\\nimpression is that carbonic acid gas is the foundation-principle of it.\\r\\nFire cannot exist in the presence of this gas--wherever it goes\\r\\nextinction of fire is instantaneous, which is more than you can say for\\r\\nwater, Joe; for as you know well, fire, when strong enough, can turn\\r\\nthat into steam as fast as you can pour it on, and after getting rid of\\r\\nit in this way, blaze up as furious as ever.  What this company proposes\\r\\nto do is to saturate water with this carbonic acid gas mixed with\\r\\nnitrogen, and then pour that prepared water on fires.  Of course, if\\r\\nmuch water were required, such a plan would never succeed, but a very\\r\\nsmall quantity is said to be sufficient.  It seems that some testing\\r\\nexperiments of a very satisfactory kind have been made recently--so you\\r\\nsee, Joe, it is time to be looking out for a new profession!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"H\\'m.  I\\'ll stick to the old brigade, at all events till the new company\\r\\nbeats us from the field.  Perhaps when that happens they\\'ll enrol some\\r\\nof us to work the--what d\\'ye call \\'em?--soda-water engines.  They\\'ll\\r\\nhave engines of course, I suppose?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course,\" replied the Bloater; \"moreover, they mean to turn their\\r\\nprepared water to good account when there are no fires to put out.  It\\r\\nis said that the proportions of the mixture can be so varied that, with\\r\\none kind, the pump may be used for the clarification of beer, oils,\\r\\ntreacle, quicksilver, and such like, and for the preservation of fruit,\\r\\nmeat, milk, etcetera, and with another mixture they propose to ventilate\\r\\nmines and tunnels; water gardens; kill insects on trees and flowers;\\r\\nsoften water for domestic uses, and breweries, and manufacture\\r\\nsoda-water, seltzer water, and other aerated beverages--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I say, Bob, hold on,\" cried Joe; \"you seem to forget that my\\r\\ncapacity for swallowing is limited.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, perhaps you\\'ll get it enlarged enough before long, to swallow all\\r\\nthat and a deal more,\" said the Bloater, with a half serious air.\\r\\n\"Meanwhile I\\'ll continue to wish all success and prosperity to the Red\\r\\nBrigade--though you _do_ cause a tremendous amount of damage by your\\r\\nfloods of water, as we poor insurance companies know.  Why, if it were\\r\\nnot for the heroes of the salvage corps we should be ruined altogether.\\r\\nIt\\'s my opinion, Joe, that the men of the salvage corps run quite as\\r\\nmuch risk as your fellows do in going through fire and smoke and working\\r\\namong falling beams and tumbling walls in order to cover goods with\\r\\ntheir tarpaulins and protect them from water.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I admit that the salvage men do their work like heroes,\" said Joe; \"but\\r\\nif you would read our chief\\'s report for last year, you would see that\\r\\nwe do our best to put out fires with the smallest possible amount of\\r\\nwater.  Why, we only used about eleven million gallons in the last\\r\\ntwelve months--a most insignificant quantity that, for the amount of\\r\\nwork done!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA tinkle of the telegraph bell here cut short the conversation.  \"Fire,\\r\\nin the Mall, Kensington,\" was the signal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get her out, lads!\" cried Joe, referring to the engine.\\r\\n\\r\\nHelmets and hatchets were donned and buckled on in the old style, and\\r\\nquiet jokes or humorous and free-and-easy remarks were uttered in slow,\\r\\neven sleepy tones, while the men acted with a degree of prompt celerity\\r\\nthat could not have been excelled had their own lives depended on their\\r\\nspeed.  In three minutes, as usual, they were off at full gallop.  The\\r\\nBloater--who still longed to follow them as of old, but had other\\r\\nbusiness on hand--wished them \"good luck,\" and proceeded at a smart pace\\r\\nto his new lodgings.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must change the scene now, for the men of the Red Brigade do not\\r\\nconfine their attentions exclusively to such matters as drilling,\\r\\nfighting, suffering, conquering, and dying.  They sometimes marry!  Let\\r\\nus look in at this little church where, as a passer-by remarks,\\r\\n\"_something_ appears to be going on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA tall handsome young man leads to the altar a delicate, beautiful,\\r\\nblooming bride, whose bent head and blushing cheek, and modest mien and\\r\\ndependent air, contrast pleasantly with the gladsome firm countenance,\\r\\nstalwart frame, and self-reliant aspect of the bridegroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at them as they stood then, no one could have entertained for a\\r\\nmoment the idea that these two had ever united in the desperate and\\r\\nstrenuous attempt to put out a fire!  Yet so it was.  They had, once\\r\\nupon a time, devoted themselves to the extinction of a fire in a\\r\\ncupboard with such enthusiasm that they had been successful not only in\\r\\nputting that fire out, but in lighting another fire, which nothing short\\r\\nof union for life could extinguish!\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe Dashwood gave away the bride, and he could not help remarking in a\\r\\nwhisper to the Bloater, (who was also there in sumptuous attire), that\\r\\nif ever a man was the born image of his father that man was Fred\\r\\nCrashington--an opinion which was heartily responded to by Mrs Maggie\\r\\nCrashington, who, then in the period of life which is described as \"fat,\\r\\nfair, and forty,\" looked on at the proceedings with intense\\r\\nsatisfaction.  Mary Dashwood--also fat, fair, and forty--was there too,\\r\\nand if ever a woman congratulated herself on a rosebud having grown into\\r\\na full blown blush-rose, that woman was Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides a pretty large company of well-dressed people, with white\\r\\nfavours in their breasts, there was a sprinkling of active men with\\r\\nsailor-like caps, who hung about the outskirts of the crowd, and among\\r\\nthese were two or three stout fellows with brass helmets and dirty hands\\r\\nand faces, and wet garments, who had returned from a recent fire, just\\r\\nin time to take a look at their comrade and his fair bride.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Ned, how his kind heart would have rejoiced to see this day!\"\\r\\nmurmured Joe, brushing his cheek hastily as he retired from the altar.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, the wedding party left the church, and the firemen returned to their\\r\\nposts of watchfulness and duty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the same period that this wedding took place, there was another\\r\\nwedding in the great metropolis to which we would draw the reader\\'s\\r\\nattention.  Not that it was a great one or a splendid one; on the\\r\\ncontrary, if it was marked by any unusual peculiarities, these were\\r\\nshabbiness and poverty.  The wedding party consisted of only two,\\r\\nbesides the bride and bridegroom, and everything was conducted with such\\r\\nquietness, and gravity, and absence of excitement, that it might almost\\r\\nhave been mistaken for a funeral on a small scale by any one\\r\\nunacquainted with the ceremonial appertaining thereto.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe happy pair, besides looking very sad, were past the meridian of\\r\\nlife.  Both were plainly dressed, and each appeared desirous of avoiding\\r\\nobservation.  The man, in particular, hung his head and moved awkwardly,\\r\\nas if begging forgiveness generally for presuming to appear in the\\r\\ncharacter of a bridegroom.  His countenance had evidently never been\\r\\nhandsome, but there was a sad subdued look about it--the result,\\r\\nperhaps, of prolonged suffering--which prevented it from being\\r\\nrepulsive.  He looked somewhat like an invalid, yet his powerful frame\\r\\nand the action of his strong muscular hands were not in keeping with\\r\\nthat idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bride, although careworn and middle-aged, possessed a singularly\\r\\nsweet and attractive countenance--all the more attractive that it wore a\\r\\nhabitual expression of sadness.  It was a sympathetic face, too, because\\r\\nit was the index to a loving, sympathetic, Christian soul, and its\\r\\never-varying indications of feeling, lightened and subdued and modified,\\r\\nbut never quite removed, the sadness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two who composed the remainder of this wedding party were young men,\\r\\napparently in a higher position of life than the principals.  The one\\r\\nwas tall and strapping, the other rather small, but remarkably active\\r\\nand handsome.  It was evident that they were deeply interested in the\\r\\nceremony in which they took part, and the smaller of the two appeared to\\r\\nenjoy some humorous reminiscences occasionally, to judge from the\\r\\nexpression of his face when his glance chanced to meet that of his tall\\r\\nfriend.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they were leaving the altar, the bridegroom bent down and murmured in\\r\\na deep soft voice--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s like a dream, Martha.  It ain\\'t easy to believe that such good\\r\\nluck should come to the likes o\\' me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bride whispered something in reply, which was inaudible to those who\\r\\nfollowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Martha, yes,\" returned the bridegroom; \"no doubt it is as you put\\r\\nit.  But after all, there\\'s only one of His sayin\\'s that has gone right\\r\\nhome to me.  I\\'ve got it by heart _now_--`I came not to call the\\r\\nrighteous, but _sinners_ to repentance.\\'  \\'Twould have bin all up with\\r\\nme long ago but for that, Martha.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey reached the door at this point, got into a cab, and drove away.\\r\\nThe remainder of the wedding party left the little church on foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same evening on which this event took place, the strapping young man\\r\\nand the little active youth sat together at the open window of a\\r\\ncomfortable though small parlour, enjoying a cup of tea.  The view from\\r\\nthe window was limited, but it possessed the charm of variety;\\r\\ncommanding as it did, a vista of chimney-pots of every shape and form\\r\\nconceivable--many of which were capped with those multiform and hideous\\r\\ncontrivances, with which foolish man vainly endeavours to cure smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Jim,\" asked the strapping youth, as he gazed pensively on this\\r\\nprospect, \"what d\\'you think of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you refer to, Bob--our view or the wedding?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The wedding, of course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s hard to say,\" replied Jim, musing.  \"He seemed to be such an\\r\\nunmitigated scoundrel when we first made his acquaintance that it is\\r\\ndifficult to believe he is a changed man now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By which you mean to insinuate, Jim, that the Gospel is not sufficient\\r\\nfor out-and-out blackguards; that it is only powerful enough to deal\\r\\nwith such modified scoundrels as you and I were.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By no means,\" replied Jim, with a peculiar smile; \"but, d\\'you know,\\r\\nBloater, I never can feel that we were such desperate villains as you\\r\\nmake us out to have been, when we swept the streets together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just listen to him!\" exclaimed the Bloater, smiting his knee with his\\r\\nfist, \"you can\\'t _feel_!--what have _feelings_ to do with knowledge?\\r\\nDon\\'t you _know_ that we were fairly and almost hopelessly _in the\\r\\ncurrent_, and that we should probably have been swept off the face of\\r\\nthe earth by this time if it had not been for that old gentleman with\\r\\nthe bald head and the kindly--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There, now, Bloater, don\\'t let us have any more of that, you become\\r\\npositively rabid when you get upon that old gentleman, and you are\\r\\nconceited enough, also, to suppose that all the gratitude in the world\\r\\nhas been shovelled into your own bosom.  Come, let us return to the\\r\\npoint, what do I think of the wedding--well, I think a good deal of it.\\r\\nThere is risk, no doubt, but there is that in everything sublunary.  I\\r\\nthink, moreover, that the marriage is founded on _true love_.  He never\\r\\nwould have come to his present condition but for true love to Martha,\\r\\nwhich, in God\\'s providence, seems to have been made the means of opening\\r\\nhis mind to Martha\\'s _message_, the pith of which message was contained\\r\\nin his last remark on leaving the church.  Then, as to Martha, our own\\r\\nknowledge of her would be sufficient to ease our minds as to her wisdom,\\r\\neven if it were not coupled with the reply she made to me when I\\r\\nexpressed wonder that she should desire to marry such a man.  `Many\\r\\nwaters,\\' she said, `cannot quench love!\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! you know something of that yourself,\" remarked Bob with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something,\" replied Little Jim, with a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, don\\'t despond,\" said the Bloater, laying his hand on Jim\\'s\\r\\nshoulder.  \"I have reason to know that the obstacles in your way shall\\r\\nsoon be removed, because that dear old gentleman with the--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was cut short by a loud, gruff shouting in the street below,\\r\\naccompanied by the rattling of wheels and the clatter of horses\\' hoofs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, there they go!\" cried Jim, his eyes glistening with enthusiasm as\\r\\nhe and his friend leaned out of the window, and strove to gain a glimpse\\r\\nof the street between the forest of chimneys, \"driving along, hammer and\\r\\ntongs, neck or nothing, always at it night and day.  A blessing on\\r\\nthem!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Amen,\" said the Bloater, as he and Jim resumed their seats and listened\\r\\nto the sound of the wheels, voices, and hoofs dying away in the\\r\\ndistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nReader, we re-echo the sentiment, and close our tale with the remark\\r\\nthat there are many rescued men and women in London who shall have\\r\\ncause, as long as life shall last, to pray for a blessing on the\\r\\noverwrought heroes who fill the ranks, and fight the battles of the Red\\r\\nBrigade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n')]"
